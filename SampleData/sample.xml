==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable, [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pinel JP |title=Biopsychology |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, Massachusetts |edition=8th |isbn=978-0-205-03099-6 |oclc=1085798897 |page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–137 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with typical [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sacks O |author-link=Oliver Sacks |title=An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales |year=1995 |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 |oclc=34359253 |lccn=94026733 |title-link=An Anthropologist on Mars }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic [[toddler]]s differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and [[turn-taking]], and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate [[nonverbal autism|nonverbal]]ly, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–233 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.492.9930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most children with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–1134 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#In individuals with autism spectrum disorder|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 327–355 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird G, Cook R | title = Mixed emotions: the contribution of alexithymia to the emotional symptoms of autism | journal = Translational Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = e285 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23880881 | pmc = 3731793 | doi = 10.1038/tp.2013.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

{{anchor|Aggression and violence}}
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M |title= Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review |journal= Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume= 28 |issue=6 |pages= 567–579 |date= November 2007 |pmid= 16973329 |doi= 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams DL, Goldstein G, Minshew NJ | title = Neuropsychologic functioning in children with autism: further evidence for disordered complex information-processing | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 4–5 | pages = 279–298 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16911973 | pmc = 1803025 | doi = 10.1080/09297040600681190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt;

* [[Stereotypy|Stereotyped behaviors]]: Repetitive movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* [[Compulsive behavior]]s: Time-consuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules, such as placing objects in a specific order, checking things, or hand washing.
* Sameness: Resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* [[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]: Unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | s2cid = 41034513 | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–866 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z | url = https://www.academia.edu/14013119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Restricted interests: Interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
* [[Self-injury]]: Behaviors such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=John2007/&gt;

==Mechanism==
{{Main|Mechanism of autism}}
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;!-- ref name=Penn/ --&gt; How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [[pathophysiology]] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [[neuropsychological]] linkages between brain structures and behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Penn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penn HE | s2cid = 46119993 | title = Neurobiological correlates of autism: a review of recent research | journal = Child Neuropsychol | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–79 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16484102 | doi = 10.1080/09297040500253546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

Several lines of evidence point to [[Synapse|synaptic]] dysfunction as a cause of autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009/&gt; Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with [[cell adhesion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Betancur&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Betancur C, Sakurai T, Buxbaum JD |s2cid=8644511 |title=The emerging role of synaptic cell-adhesion pathways in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders |journal=[[Trends Neurosci]] |volume=32 |issue=7 |pages=402–412 |year=2009 |pmid=19541375 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2009.04.003|url=http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00401195/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walsh CA, Morrow EM, Rubenstein JL |title=Autism and brain development |journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]] |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=396–400 |year=2008 |pmid=18984148 |pmc=2701104 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All known [[teratogen]]s (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]], and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arndt&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |s2cid=17797266 |title=The teratology of autism |journal=[[Int J Dev Neurosci]] |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–199 |year=2005 |pmid=15749245 |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Land2008/&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dover&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–545 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 | pmc=2066173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–135 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | last = Cass |first = Hilary | author-link = Hilary Cass | s2cid = 146237979 |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–138|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geschwind&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geschwind DH | title = Autism: many genes, common pathways? | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 3 | pages = 391–395 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18984147 | pmc = 2756410 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = New developments in autism | journal = Psychiatr Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19248913 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Lev2009/&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B | s2cid = 9331084 | title = Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 943–955 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11733747 | doi = 10.1038/35103559}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | s2cid = 16386209 | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain Dev | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–272 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of [[Intelligence assessment|assessing]] [[Controversies in autism#Intelligence|intelligence]] of individuals on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Learning in autism |vauthors=Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title=Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–772 |veditors=Byrne JH, Roediger HL |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=978-0-12-370504-4 |oclc=775005136 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |access-date=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–3099 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L | title = Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–229 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence SJ, Schneider MT | title = The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–606 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19454962 | pmc = 2692092 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P | s2cid = 30809774 | title = Autism and metabolic diseases | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–314 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18079313 | doi = 10.1177/0883073807308698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minor physical anomalies]]''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H | title = Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–307 | year = 2010 | pmid = 18626481 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2008.75 | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | s2cid = 11831418 | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–1101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | url = https://www.academia.edu/24262348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–411 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named.

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | s2cid = 5317716 | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–366 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603}} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt; A Soviet child psychiatrist, [[Grunya Sukhareva]], described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manouilenko I, Bejerot S|s2cid=207473133|title=Sukhareva—Prior to Asperger and Kanner|journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry|type=Report|publication-date=31 March 2015|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1761–1764|doi=10.3109/08039488.2015.1005022|issn=1502-4725|pmid=25826582|year=2015|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:oru:diva-47358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical development and diagnoses ===
[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Balding man in his early 60s in coat and tie, with a serious but slightly smiling expression|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–1317 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans-title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–250 |year=1943| issue = 4 | pmid = 4880460 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title = Autistic disturbances of affective contact | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–136 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | s2cid = 38130758 | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–2023 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald Triplett]] was the first person diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as &quot;case 1&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pallardy|first1=Richard| name-list-format = vanc |title=Donald Triplett|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Triplett|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian [[catechism]]. He was also interested in creating musical chords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donvan|first1=John|last2=Zucker|first2=Caren | name-list-format = vanc |title=Autism's First Child|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/|access-date=19 March 2017|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | s2cid = 8868418 | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–505 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp| doi = 10.1177/070674370304800801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders | vauthors = Szatmari P, Jones MB | author-link1 = Peter Szatmari | pages=157–178 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | s2cid = 19769173 | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–1327 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 | url = https://www.academia.edu/20027016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | s2cid = 2015723 | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–330 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It took until 1980 for the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the [[DSM-III-R]] provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the [[DSM-5]] was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including [[PDD-NOS]], autism, [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Rett syndrome]], and [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|CDD]], has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker JP | title = Autism at 70--redrawing the boundaries | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 12 | pages = 1089–1091 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24047057 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1306380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biever C | title = Web removes social barriers for those with autism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2610 |pages=26–27 |year=2007 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020165135/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426106.100 |archivedate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism]] have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that [[Neurodiversity|autism is simply another way of being]].&lt;ref name=Sil2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Frith2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | vauthors = Harmon A |title=How about not 'curing' us, some autistics are pleading |date=20 December 2004 |work=The New York Times |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130511002649/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html |archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism rights movement ===
The [[autism rights movement]] is a [[social movement]] within the context of [[disability rights movement|disability right]]s that emphasizes the concept of [[neurodiversity]], viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the [[human brain]] rather than a disorder to be cured.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism,&lt;ref name=Bigthink&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ratner |first1=Paul | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Should Autism Be Cured or Is &quot;Curing&quot; Offensive? |url=https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/should-autism-be-cured-or-is-curing-offfensive |website=Big Think |access-date=16 June 2019 |date=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the recognition of the autistic community as a [[minority group]].&lt;ref name=Bigthink/&gt;&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaarsma P, Welin S | s2cid = 18618887 | title = Autism as a natural human variation: reflections on the claims of the neurodiversity movement | journal = Health Care Analysis | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–30 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 21311979 | doi = 10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 | url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-72172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the [[human genome]]. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and [[fringe theories]] that autism is caused by environmental factors such as [[vaccine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;/&gt; A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are &quot;[[High-functioning autism|high-functioning]]&quot; or have [[Asperger syndrome]] and do not represent the views of &quot;[[Low-functioning autism|low-functioning]]&quot; autistic people.&lt;ref name= Jaarsma2012/&gt; 

===Employment===
About half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohl A, Grice Sheff M, Small S, Nguyen J, Paskor K, Zanjirian A | title = Predictors of employment status among adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder | journal = Work | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 345–355 |year = 2017 | pmid = 28211841 | doi = 10.3233/WOR-172492 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=DePillis |first1=Lydia | name-list-format = vanc |title=Disabled people are allowed to work for pennies per hour – but maybe not for much longer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/12/disabled-people-are-allowed-to-work-for-pennies-per-hour-but-maybe-not-for-much-longer/?noredirect=on |access-date=31 December 2018 |work=The Washington Post|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohl&quot;/&gt; A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ganz ML | title = The lifetime distribution of the incremental societal costs of autism | journal = Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–349 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17404130 | doi = 10.1001/archpedi.161.4.343 | lay-url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2006-releases/press04252006.html | laydate = 25 April 2006 | laysource = Harvard School of Public Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | s2cid = 55179 | title = Association of childhood autism spectrum disorders and loss of family income | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = e821–26 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18381511 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-1594 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100304071520/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/121/4/e821 | archivedate = 4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montes G, Halterman JS | s2cid = 22686553 | title = Child care problems and employment among families with preschool-aged children with autism in the United States | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = e202–08 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18595965 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-3037 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091206190622/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/122/1/e202 | archivedate = 6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the principal city of the Ann Arbor [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which encompasses all of Washtenaw County. Ann Arbor is also included in the larger [[Metro Detroit|Greater Detroit]] [[Combined statistical area|Combined Statistical Area]].

Ann Arbor is home to the [[University of Michigan]]. The university significantly shapes Ann Arbor's economy as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | title=Ann Arbor: Introduction | publisher=Advameg, Inc. | year=2008 | accessdate=August 4, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610084107/http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | archivedate=June 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders, both named Ann, and the stands of [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur oak]] trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;&gt;Marwil, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Michigan moved from [[Detroit]] to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate in the early to mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became a focal point for political activism, such as [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] and [[Cannabis laws in Ann Arbor, Michigan|support for the legalization of cannabis]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}

In about 1774, the [[Potawatomi]] founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Edmonds|first= R. David |year=1978 |title=The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire |publisher= University of Oklahoma |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators [[John Allen (pioneer)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Walker Rumsey]]. On May 25, 1824, the town [[plat]] was registered with Wayne County as &quot;Annarbour&quot;, the earliest known use of the town's name.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[Quercus macrocarpa#Cultural|bur oak]] in the {{convert|640|acre|ha}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marwil, pp. 1-2&quot;/&gt; The local [[Ojibwe people|Ojibwa]] named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's [[sawmill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society|title=Michigan History Magazine|year=1964|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was incorporated as a village in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capitol, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved from Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Marwil, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing 15 years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;aadl2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space.

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, [[gentrification]], and [[urban sprawl]] stretching into outlying countryside.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], the large number of [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from [[Michigan Stadium]] until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual [[Hash Bash]]: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April.

These elections were staggered, with each ward having one of their seats up for election in odd years and their other seat up for election in even years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt; Beginning in 2018 the City Council has had staggered elections to 4-year terms in even years. This means that half of the members (one from each ward) are elected in presidential election years, while the other half are elected in mid-term election years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt; To facilitate this change in scheduling, the 2017 election elected members to terms that lasted 3-years.&lt;ref name=a2cc/&gt;

In 1960, Ann Arbor voters approved a $2.3 million [[Bond (finance)|bond issue]] to build the current city hall, which was designed by architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The City Hall opened in 1963. In 1995, the building was renamed the Guy C. Larcom, Jr. Municipal Building in honor of the longtime city administrator who championed the building's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/guy-larcoms-name-peeled-from-exterior-of-city-hall-but-building-will-remain-named-in-his-honor/ |title=Guy Larcom's name peeled from exterior of city hall, but building will remain named in his honor |publisher=Annarbor.com |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323134619/http://www.annarbor.com/news/guy-larcoms-name-peeled-from-exterior-of-city-hall-but-building-will-remain-named-in-his-honor/ |archivedate=March 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

===Surface roads and paths===
The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a [[grid pattern]], though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]], which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|U.S. Highway 23]] (US&amp;nbsp;23), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]], which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&amp;nbsp;12]] (Michigan Ave.), [[M-17 (Michigan highway)|M-17]] (Washtenaw Ave.), and [[M-153 (Michigan highway)|M-153]] (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;MDOT07&quot;&gt;{{cite map|publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |title=Official 2007 Department of Transportation Map |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9622_11033_11151---,00.html |year=2007 |scale=1&amp;nbsp;in:15&amp;nbsp;mi/1&amp;nbsp;cm:9&amp;nbsp;km |section=C1–C11 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502044505/http://michigan.gov/mdot/0%2C1607%2C7-151-9622_11033_11151---%2C00.html |archivedate= May 2, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also has a system of bike routes and [[bike path|path]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/images/bike.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605152004/http://www.a2gov.org/CommunityServices/Parks/images/bike.pdf | archivedate=June 5, 2007 | title=City of Ann Arbor Bikeway System | year=2007 | publisher=City of Ann Arbor and Washtenaw County | accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County [[Border-to-Border Trail]].&lt;ref name=&quot;B2B&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Friends of the Border to Border Trail | url=http://www.bordertoborder.org/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110220623/http://www.bordertoborder.org/ | archivedate=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bus service===
The [[Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority]] (AAATA), which brands itself as &quot;TheRide&quot;, operates public [[bus]] services throughout the city and nearby [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]]. The AATA operates Blake Transit Center on Fourth Ave. in downtown Ann Arbor, and the Ypsilanti Transit Center. A separate [[zero-fare]] bus service operates within and between the University of Michigan campuses.  Since April 2012, route 98 (the &quot;AirRide&quot;) connects to [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metro Airport]] a dozen times a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.michiganradio.org/post/new-airride-bus-travels-between-ann-arbor-and-detroit-metro | title=New AirRide bus travels between Ann Arbor and Detroit Metro | publisher=Michigan Radio|accessdate=March 30, 2013| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323170945/http://michiganradio.org/post/new-airride-bus-travels-between-ann-arbor-and-detroit-metro| archivedate=March 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also limited-stop bus services between Ann Arbor and [[Chelsea, Michigan|Chelsea]] as well as [[Canton, Michigan|Canton]].

===Railroads===
The city was a major rail hub, notably for freight traffic between [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and ports north of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], from 1878 to 1982; however, the [[Ann Arbor Railroad (1895–1976)|Ann Arbor Railroad]] also provided passenger service from 1878 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarke.cmich.edu/resource_tab/information_and_exhibits/michigan's_ann_arbor_railroads/a_brief_history.html |title=A Brief History |publisher=Central Michigan University—Clarke Historical Library |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203085713/http://clarke.cmich.edu/resource_tab/information_and_exhibits/michigan%27s_ann_arbor_railroads/a_brief_history.html |archivedate= February 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was served by the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] starting in 1837.

'''Asteroids''' are [[minor planet]]s, especially of the [[Solar System#Inner solar system|inner Solar System]]. Larger asteroids have also been called '''planetoids'''. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active [[comet]] such as a tail. As [[Distant minor planet|minor planets in the outer Solar System]] were discovered that were found to have [[Volatiles|volatile]]-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref name=JPL-Asteroids/&gt;

In this article, the term &quot;asteroid&quot; refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with [[Jupiter]].

==Overview==
Millions of asteroids exist, many the shattered remnants of [[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun's [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s.&lt;ref name=CNEOS-FAQ/&gt; The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of [[Mars]] and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter trojan]]s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is almost {{cvt|1000|sigfig=1|km}} across and massive enough to qualify as a [[dwarf planet]].

Asteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.&lt;ref name=CalTech-what-diff/&gt; The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.&lt;ref name=Rubin2010/&gt; Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universe Today&quot;/&gt;

Only one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively [[Albedo|reflective surface]], is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned. Rarely, small asteroids passing close to Earth may be visible to the naked eye for a short time.&lt;ref name=SPACE-2004-02-04/&gt; {{As of|2020|3|df=dmy}}, the [[Minor Planet Center]] had data on 930,000&amp;nbsp;minor planets in the inner and outer Solar System, of which about 545,000 had enough information to be given numbered designations.&lt;ref name=MPCcount/&gt;

=== Historical methods ===
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2018}}
Asteroid discovery methods have dramatically improved over the past two centuries.

In the last years of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, Baron [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] organized a group of 24&amp;nbsp;astronomers to search the sky for the missing planet predicted at about 2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] from the Sun by the [[Titius-Bode law]], partly because of the discovery, by Sir [[William Herschel]] in 1781, of the planet [[Uranus]] at the distance predicted by the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCall |first1=Gerald J.H. |last2=Bowden |first2=A.J. |last3=Howarth |first3=Richard J. |date=2006 |title=The History of Meteoritics and Key Meteorite Collections: Fireballs, Falls and Finds |publisher=Geological Society of London |isbn=978-1-86239-194-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SvtVoa1W-cC&amp;pg=PA46 |via=Google Books |lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task required that hand-drawn sky charts be prepared for all stars in the [[zodiac]]al band down to an agreed-upon limit of faintness. On subsequent nights, the sky would be charted again and any moving object would, hopefully, be spotted. The expected motion of the missing planet was about 30&amp;nbsp;seconds of arc per hour, readily discernible by observers.

The first object, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], was not discovered by a member of the group, but rather by accident in 1801 by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], director of the observatory of [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]]. He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. Later that year, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object, which was found to be between the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;/&gt;

Three other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], and [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

However, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime year 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J.R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis|A. de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|R. Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H.M.S. Goldschmidt]], [[Jean Chacornac|J. Chacornac]], [[James Ferguson (astronomer)|J. Ferguson]], [[Norman Robert Pogson|N.R. Pogson]], [[Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel|E.W. Tempel]], [[James Craig Watson|J.C. Watson]], [[Christian Heinrich Friedrich Peters|C.H.F. Peters]], [[Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly|A. Borrelly]], [[Johann Palisa|J. Palisa]], [[Paul Henry and Prosper Henry|the Henry brothers]] and [[Auguste Charlois|A. Charlois]].

In 1891, [[Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf|Max Wolf]] pioneered the use of [[astrophotography]] to detect asteroids, which appeared as short streaks on long-exposure photographic plates. This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248&amp;nbsp;asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point. It was known that there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, some calling them &quot;vermin of the skies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Lou |title=Vermin of the Sky |website=The Planetary Society |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/lou-friedman/20130219-vermin-of-the-sky.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase variously attributed to [[Eduard Suess|E.

=== Manual methods of the 1900s and modern reporting ===
Until 1998, asteroids were discovered by a four-step process. First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chapman |first=Mary G. |date=17 May 1992 |title=Carolyn Shoemaker, planetary astronomer and most successful 'comet hunter' to date |publisher=USGS |department=Astrogeology |url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker |access-date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).

The last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].

=== Computerized methods ===
[[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]
[[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Cumulative discoveries of just the near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980–2017]]
There is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth ''(see [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroids]])''. The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s.&lt;!--- ''Project Icarus'' ---&gt;

The [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] of [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.

Two events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its [[military satellite]]s, built to [[detect nuclear explosions]], had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across.

All these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. {{As of|2011}}, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.&lt;ref name=nasa_neo/&gt; A list of teams using such systems includes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Traditionally, small bodies orbiting the Sun were classified as [[comet]]s, asteroids, or [[meteoroid]]s, with anything smaller than one meter across being called a meteoroid.

However, following the discovery of asteroids below ten meters in size, Rubin and Grossman's 2010 paper revised the previous definition of meteoroid to objects between 10&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] and 1&amp;nbsp;meter in size in order to maintain the distinction between asteroids and meteoroids.&lt;ref name=Rubin2010/&gt; The smallest asteroids discovered (based on [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] ''H'') are {{mp|2008 TS|26}} with {{nowrap|{{mvar|H}} = 33.2}} and {{mpl|2011 CQ|1}} with {{nowrap|{{mvar|H}} = 32.1}} both with an estimated size of about 1&amp;nbsp;meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=JPL Small-Body Database browser |title=2011 CQ{{sub|1}} |type=2011-02-04 last obs |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2011CQ1;cad=1#cad |publisher=NASA |department=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the term &quot;[[small Solar System body]]&quot; was also introduced to cover both most minor planets and comets.&lt;ref name=IAU-2006/&gt;{{efn|The definition of &quot;small Solar System bodies&quot; says that they &quot;include most of the Solar System asteroids, most trans-Neptunian objects, comets, and other small bodies&quot;.}} Other languages prefer &quot;planetoid&quot; (Greek for &quot;planet-like&quot;), and this term is occasionally used in English especially for larger minor planets such as the [[dwarf planet]]s as well as an alternative for asteroids since they are not star-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar System modeling |first=E.J. |last=Chaisson |publisher=Harvard University |department=Center for Astronomy |lang=en |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/text/text_plan_1.html |access-date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;[[planetesimal]]&quot; has a similar meaning, but refers specifically to the small building blocks of the planets that existed when the Solar System was forming. The term &quot;planetule&quot; was coined by the geologist [[William Daniel Conybeare]] to describe minor planets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Meaning of ''Planetule'' |website=Hyper-dictionary |url=http://www.hyperdictionary.com/dictionary/planetule |access-date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is not in common use. The three largest objects in the asteroid belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], grew to the stage of [[protoplanet]]s. Ceres is a [[dwarf planet]], the only one in the inner Solar System.

When found, asteroids were seen as a class of objects distinct from comets, and there was no unified term for the two until &quot;small Solar System body&quot; was coined in 2006. The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most &quot;asteroids&quot; with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weissman |first1=Paul R. |last2=Bottke |first2=William F.

For almost two centuries, from the discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] in 1801 until the discovery of the first [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]], [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]] in 1977, all known asteroids spent most of their time at or within the orbit of Jupiter, though a few such as [[944 Hidalgo|Hidalgo]] ventured far beyond Jupiter for part of their orbit. Those located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter were known for many years simply as The Asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |access-date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When astronomers started finding more small bodies that permanently resided further out than Jupiter, now called [[centaur (minor planet)|centaurs]], they numbered them among the traditional asteroids, though there was debate over whether they should be considered asteroids or as a new type of object. Then, when the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] (other than [[Pluto]]), [[15760 Albion|Albion]], was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt object]], [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[scattered-disc object]], and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.

The innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]], called &quot;objects&quot; partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.&lt;ref name=KBOasteroids&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Kuiper Belt objects asteroids? |website=Ask an astronomer |publisher=Cornell University |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110110/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |archive-date=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicholas M., Sr. |last=Short |title=Asteroids and Comets |publisher=NASA |department=Goddard Space Flight Center |url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925014037/http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov///Sect19/Sect19_22.html |archive-date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, most do not have the highly eccentric orbits associated with comets, and the ones so far discovered are larger than traditional [[Comet nucleus|comet nuclei]]. (The much more distant [[Oort cloud]] is hypothesized to be the main reservoir of dormant comets.)

The minor planets beyond Jupiter's orbit are sometimes also called &quot;asteroids&quot;, especially in popular presentations.{{efn|For instance, a joint [[NASA]]–[[JPL]] public-outreach website states: {{quote|&quot;We include Trojans (bodies captured in Jupiter's 4th and 5th Lagrange points), Centaurs (bodies in orbit between Jupiter and Neptune), and trans-Neptunian objects (orbiting beyond Neptune) in our definition of &quot;asteroid&quot; as used on this site, even though they may more correctly be called &quot;minor planets&quot; instead of asteroids.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}}}}} However, it is becoming increasingly common for the term &quot;asteroid&quot; to be restricted to minor planets of the inner Solar System.&lt;ref name=KBOasteroids/&gt; Therefore, this article will restrict itself for the most part to the classical asteroids: objects of the [[asteroid belt]], [[Jupiter trojan]]s, and [[near-Earth object]]s.

When the IAU introduced the class [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]] in 2006 to include most objects previously classified as minor planets and comets, they created the class of [[dwarf planet]]s for the largest minor planets – those that have enough mass to have become ellipsoidal under their own gravity. According to the IAU, &quot;the term 'minor planet' may still be used, but generally the term 'Small Solar System Body' will be preferred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/ |title=Pluto |series=Questions and Answers on Planets |publisher=International Astrophysical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently only the largest object in the asteroid belt, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at about {{cvt|975|km|0}} across, has been placed in the dwarf planet category.

== Formation ==
It is thought that [[planetesimal]]s in the asteroid belt evolved much like the rest of the [[solar nebula]] until Jupiter neared its current mass, at which point excitation from [[orbital resonance]]s with Jupiter ejected over 99% of planetesimals in the belt. Simulations and a discontinuity in spin rate and spectral properties suggest that asteroids larger than approximately {{cvt|120|km|0}} in diameter [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] during that early era, whereas smaller bodies are fragments from collisions between asteroids during or after the Jovian disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bottke |first1=William F., Jr. |last2=Durda |first2=Daniel D. |last3=Nesvorny |first3=David |last4=Jedicke |first4=Robert |last5=Morbidelli |first5=Alessandro |last6=Vokrouhlicky |first6=David |last7=Levison |first7=Hal |year=2005 |title=The fossilized size distribution of the main asteroid belt |journal=Icarus |volume=175 |issue=1 |page=111 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.10.026 |bibcode=2005Icar..175..111B |url=http://astro.mff.cuni.cz/davok/papers/fossil05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres and Vesta grew large enough to melt and [[Planetary differentiation|differentiate]], with heavy metallic elements sinking to the core, leaving rocky minerals in the crust.&lt;ref name=ACM&gt;{{cite book |title=Asteroids, Comets, and Meteors |last=Kerrod |first=Robin |year=2000 |publisher=Lerner Publications Co. |isbn=978-0-585-31763-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/asteroidscometsm00robi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Nice model]], many [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]] are captured in the outer asteroid belt, at distances greater than 2.6&amp;nbsp;AU. Most were later ejected by Jupiter, but those that remained may be the [[D-type asteroid]]s, and possibly include Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McKinnon |first1=William |first2=B. |last2=McKinnon |year=2008 |title=On The Possibility of Large KBOs Being Injected into The Outer Asteroid Belt |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |volume=40 |page=464 |bibcode=2008DPS....40.3803M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|right|The [[asteroid belt]] (white) and Jupiter's [[trojan asteroids]] (green)]]
Various dynamical groups of asteroids have been discovered orbiting in the inner Solar System. Their orbits are perturbed by the gravity of other bodies in the Solar System and by the [[Yarkovsky effect]]. Significant populations include:

=== Asteroid belt ===
{{main|Asteroid belt}}
The majority of known asteroids orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], generally in relatively low-[[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] (i.e. not very elongated) orbits. This belt is now estimated to contain between 1.1 and 1.9&amp;nbsp;million asteroids larger than {{cvt|1|km|1}} in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and millions of smaller ones. These asteroids may be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disk]], and in this region the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of [[planetesimal]]s into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]].

=== Trojans ===
{{main|Trojan (astronomy)}}
[[Trojan (astronomy)|Trojans]] are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two [[Lagrangian point]]s of stability, [[Trojan points|L4 and L5]], which lie 60° ahead of and behind the larger body.
The most significant population of trojans are the [[Jupiter trojan]]s. Although fewer Jupiter trojans have been discovered ({{as of|2010}}), it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. Trojans have been found in the orbits of other planets, including [[Venus trojan|Venus]], [[Earth trojan|Earth]], [[Mars trojan|Mars]], [[Uranus trojan|Uranus]], and [[Neptune trojan|Neptune]].

=== Near-Earth asteroids ===
[[File:Asteroids-KnownNearEarthObjects-Animation-UpTo20180101.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|&lt;center&gt;Known [[Near-Earth objects]] as of January&amp;nbsp;2018&lt;br/&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfvo-Ujb_qk Video (0:55; 23&amp;nbsp;July 2018)]&lt;/center&gt;]]

Near-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as ''Earth-crossers''. {{As of|2016|06}}, 14,464&amp;nbsp;near-Earth asteroids are known&lt;ref name=nasa_neo&gt;{{cite web |title=Discovery Statistics |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/ |website=CNEOS |access-date=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number over one kilometer in diameter is estimated to be 900–1,000.

== Characteristics ==

=== Size distribution ===
[[File:Asteroids by size and number.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The asteroids of the Solar System, categorized by size and number]]
Asteroids vary greatly in size, from almost {{val|1000|u=km}} for the largest down to rocks just 1&amp;nbsp;meter across.{{efn|Below 1&amp;nbsp;meter, these are considered to be [[meteoroid]]s. The definition in the 1995 paper (Beech and Steel) has been updated by a 2010 paper (Rubin and Grossman) and the discovery of 1&amp;nbsp;meter asteroids.}} The three largest are very much like miniature planets: they are roughly spherical, have at least partly differentiated interiors,&lt;ref name=Schmidt2007&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hubble Space Telescope Observations of 2&amp;nbsp;Pallas |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |volume=39 |page=485 |date=2007 |display-authors=6 |author1=Schmidt, B. |author2=Russell, C.T. |author3=Bauer, J.M. |author4=Li, J. |author5=McFadden, L.A. |author6=Mutchler, M. |author7=Parker, J.W. |author8=Rivkin, A.S. |author9=Stern, S.A. |author10=Thomas, P.C. |bibcode=2007DPS....39.3519S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are thought to be surviving [[protoplanet]]s. The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either battered [[planetesimal]]s or fragments of larger bodies.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of {{cvt|940|km|-1}}. The next largest are [[4 Vesta]] and [[2 Pallas]], both with diameters of just over {{cvt|500|km|-2}}. Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]].

The mass of all the objects of the [[asteroid belt]], lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], is estimated to be in the range of {{val|2.8|-|3.2|e=21|u=kg}}, about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] comprises {{val|.938|e=21|u=kg}}, about a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (9%), [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] (7%), and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]] (3%), brings this figure up to half, whereas the three most-massive asteroids after that, [[511 Davida]] (1.2%), [[704 Interamnia]] (1.0%), and [[52 Europa]] (0.9%), constitute only another 3%. The number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.

The number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a [[power law]], there are 'bumps' at {{val|5|u=km}} and {{val|100|u=km}}, where more asteroids than expected from a [[logarithmic distribution]] are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Davis |year=2002 |title=Asteroids&amp;nbsp;III}} cited by {{cite web |first=Željko |last=Ivezić |year=2004 |title=Lecture&amp;nbsp;4: Moving objects detected by SDSS |publisher=University of Washington |department=Astronomy Department |series=Lecture notes for ASTR&amp;nbsp;598 |url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111753/http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Largest asteroids====
[[File:The Four Largest Asteroids.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The four largest asteroids: 1&amp;nbsp;Ceres, 4&amp;nbsp;Vesta, 2&amp;nbsp;Pallas, and 10&amp;nbsp;Hygiea]]
{{See also|Largest asteroids}}
Although their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status, the three largest objects, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], and [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], are intact [[protoplanet]]s that share many characteristics common to planets, and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly shaped asteroids. The fourth largest asteroid, [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]], appears nearly spherical although it may have an undifferentiated interior{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}, like the majority of asteroids. Between them, the four largest asteroids constitute half the mass of the asteroid belt.

Ceres is the only asteroid with a fully ellipsoidal shape and hence the only one that is a [[dwarf planet]].&lt;ref name=IAU-2006/&gt; It has a much higher [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] than the other asteroids, of around 3.32,&lt;ref name=AstJ-2002-v123-p549/&gt; and may possess a surface layer of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetary&quot;/&gt; Like the planets, Ceres is differentiated: it has a crust, a mantle and a core.&lt;ref name=&quot;planetary&quot;/&gt; No meteorites from Ceres have been found on Earth.

Vesta, too, has a differentiated interior, though it formed inside the Solar System's [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], and so is devoid of water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Asteroid or mini-planet?

Vesta is the parent body of the [[Vestian family]] and other [[V-type asteroid]]s, and is the source of the [[HED meteorite]]s, which constitute 5% of all meteorites on Earth.

Pallas is unusual in that, like [[Uranus]], it rotates on its side, with its axis of rotation tilted at high angles to its orbital plane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torppa1996&quot;/&gt; Its composition is similar to that of Ceres: high in carbon and silicon, and perhaps partially differentiated.&lt;ref name=Icarus-1983-v56-p398/&gt; Pallas is the parent body of the [[Palladian family]] of asteroids.

Hygiea is the largest carbonaceous asteroid&lt;ref name=Icarus-2002-156-p202/&gt; and, unlike the other largest asteroids, lies relatively close to the [[plane of the ecliptic]].&lt;ref name=OrbitSimltr/&gt; It is the largest member and presumed parent body of the [[Hygiean family]] of asteroids. Because there is no sufficiently large crater on the surface to be the source of that family, as there is on Vesta, it is thought that Hygiea may have been completely disrupted in the collision that formed the Hygiean family, and recoalesced after losing a bit less than 2% of its mass. Observations taken with the [[Very Large Telescope]]'s [[VLT-SPHERE|SPHERE]] imager in 2017 and 2018, and announced in late 2019, revealed that Hygiea has a nearly spherical shape, which is at consistent both with it being in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (and thus a [[dwarf planet]]), or formerly being in hydrostatic equilibrium, or with being disrupted and recoalescing.&lt;ref name=NatAstr-2019-10-28/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strickland2019/&gt;

=== Rotation ===
Measurements of the rotation rates of large asteroids in the asteroid belt show that there is an upper limit. Very few asteroids with a diameter larger than 100 meters have a rotation period smaller than 2.2&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Lightcurves |series=Asteroid Lightcurve Photometry Database |website=ALCDEF |date=4 December 2018 |url=http://alcdef.org/ |access-date=27 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For asteroids rotating faster than approximately this rate, the inertial force at the surface is greater than the gravitational force, so any loose surface material would be flung out. However, a solid object should be able to rotate much more rapidly. This suggests that most asteroids with a diameter over 100 meters are [[rubble pile]]s formed through accumulation of debris after collisions between asteroids.&lt;ref name=Rossi-2004/&gt;

{{further|List of fast rotators (minor planets)|List of slow rotators (minor planets)}}

=== Composition ===
[[File:Vesta Cratered terrain with hills and ridges.jpg|thumb|right|Cratered terrain on 4 Vesta]]
The physical composition of asteroids is varied and in most cases poorly understood. Ceres appears to be composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta is thought to have a [[nickel-iron]] core, [[olivine]] mantle, and basaltic crust.&lt;ref name=Hubble-Vespa-1995-04-19/&gt; [[10 Hygiea]], however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of [[carbonaceous chondrite]], is thought to be the largest undifferentiated asteroid. Most of the smaller asteroids are thought to be piles of rubble held together loosely by gravity, though the largest are probably solid. Some asteroids have [[Asteroid moon|moons]] or are co-orbiting [[binary asteroid|binaries]]: Rubble piles, moons, binaries, and scattered [[asteroid family|asteroid families]] are thought to be the results of collisions that disrupted a parent asteroid, or, possibly, a [[disrupted planet|planet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ARX-20060816&quot;/&gt;

Asteroids contain traces of [[amino acid]]s and other organic compounds, and some speculate that asteroid impacts may have seeded the early Earth with the chemicals necessary to initiate life, or may have even brought life itself to Earth ''(also see [[panspermia]])''.&lt;ref name=SPACE-2001-12-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reuell-2019/&gt; In August&amp;nbsp;2011, a report, based on [[NASA]] studies with [[meteorite]]s found on [[Earth]], was published suggesting [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] components ([[adenine]], [[guanine]] and related [[organic molecules]]) may have been formed on asteroids and [[comet]]s in [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Callahan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steigerwald&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA&quot;/&gt;
[[File:PIA18469-AsteroidCollision-NearStarNGC2547-ID8-2013.jpg|thumb|right|Asteroid collision{{Snd}} building planets (artist concept).]]
Composition is calculated from three primary sources: [[albedo]], surface spectrum, and density. The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&amp;nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268×186×183&amp;nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384×262×232&amp;nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87&amp;nbsp;Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.&lt;ref name=Icarus-2011-02-p1022/&gt;

On 7&amp;nbsp;October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]]. The surface of the asteroid appears completely covered in ice. As this [[ice]] layer is [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimating]], it may be getting replenished by a reservoir of ice under the surface. Organic compounds were also detected on the surface.&lt;ref name=Cowen-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkinson-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campins2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=RivkinEmery2010/&gt; Scientists hypothesize that some of the first water brought to [[Earth]] was delivered by asteroid impacts after the collision that produced the [[Moon]]. The presence of ice on 24 Themis supports this theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campins2010&quot;/&gt;

In October 2013, water was detected on an extrasolar body for the first time, on an asteroid orbiting the [[white dwarf]] [[GD 61]].&lt;ref name=Mack-CNET/&gt; On 22&amp;nbsp;January 2014, [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of [[water vapor]] on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], the largest object in the asteroid belt.&lt;ref name=&quot;KüppersO'Rourke2014&quot;/&gt; The detection was made by using the [[Far-infrared astronomy|far-infrared abilities]] of the [[Herschel Space Observatory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20140122&quot;/&gt; The finding is unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to &quot;sprout jets and plumes&quot;. According to one of the scientists, &quot;The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20140122&quot;/&gt;

In May&amp;nbsp;2016, significant asteroid data arising from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] and [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer#NEOWISE|NEOWISE]] missions have been questioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARX-20160523&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20160523&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SA-20160527&quot;/&gt; Although the early original criticism had not undergone peer review,&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20160525&quot;/&gt; a more recent peer-reviewed study was subsequently published.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICARUS-20180522&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20180614c&quot;/&gt;

In November 2019, scientists reported detecting, for the first time, [[Sugar|sugar molecules]], including [[ribose]], in [[meteorite]]s, suggesting that chemical processes on asteroids can produce some fundamentally essential bio-ingredients important to [[life]], and supporting the notion of an [[RNA world]] prior to a DNA-based [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] on Earth, and possibly, as well, the notion of [[panspermia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA-20191118&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-20191118&quot;/&gt;

=== Surface features ===
Most asteroids outside the &quot;[[List of exceptional asteroids#Largest by mass|big four]]&quot; (Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea) are likely to be broadly similar in appearance, if irregular in shape. 50&amp;nbsp;km (31&amp;nbsp;mi) [[253 Mathilde]] is a rubble pile saturated with craters with diameters the size of the asteroid's radius, and Earth-based observations of 300&amp;nbsp;km (186&amp;nbsp;mi) [[511 Davida]], one of the largest asteroids after the big four, reveal a similarly angular profile, suggesting it is also saturated with radius-size craters.&lt;ref name=Icarus-2007-v191-p616/&gt; Medium-sized asteroids such as Mathilde and [[243 Ida]] that have been observed up close also reveal a deep [[regolith]] covering the surface. Of the big four, Pallas and Hygiea are practically unknown. Vesta has compression fractures encircling a radius-size crater at its south pole but is otherwise a [[spheroid]]. Ceres seems quite different in the glimpses Hubble has provided, with surface features that are unlikely to be due to simple craters and impact basins, but details will be expanded with the ''[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]]'', which entered Ceres orbit on 6&amp;nbsp;March 2015.&lt;ref name=Boyle2015Mar06/&gt;

=== Color ===
Asteroids become darker and redder with age due to [[space weathering]].&lt;ref name=UHi2005-05-19/&gt; However evidence suggests most of the color change occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.&lt;ref name=Courtland-2009/&gt;

== Classification ==
[[File:Kirkwood-20060509.png|thumb|Showing [[Kirkwood gaps]], by showing positions based on their semi-major axis]]
Asteroids are commonly categorized according to two criteria: the characteristics of their orbits, and features of their reflectance [[visible spectrum|spectrum]].

=== Orbital classification ===
{{Main|Asteroid group|Asteroid family}}
Many asteroids have been placed in groups and families based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.&lt;ref name=AstFams-Icarus-1995/&gt; Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewittEtal2004&quot;/&gt; Main belt families were first recognized by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor.

About 30–35% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.

==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====
Some asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].

Sometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.

Such objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.

=== Spectral classification ===
{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}
[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{cvt|35|m|0}} across can be seen.]]
In 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman|Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner|Zellner]].&lt;ref name=CMZ-1975-Icarus/&gt; These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.

The two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14&amp;nbsp;asteroid categories.&lt;ref name=Tholen-1989/&gt; In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24&amp;nbsp;different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.&lt;ref name=Bus-2002/&gt;

The proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.

==== Problems ====
Originally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.&lt;ref name=McSween-1999/&gt; However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of the same (or similar) materials.

== Naming ==
{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}
[[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]]
A newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the [[half-month]] of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. {{nowrap|[[433 Eros]]}}). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number – e.g. (433)&amp;nbsp;Eros – but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.&lt;ref name=OpenUNamingAstrds/&gt; In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.&lt;ref name=PlanSocNameGuides/&gt;

=== Symbols ===
{{main|Astronomical symbols}}
The first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets. By 1855 there were two dozen asteroid symbols, which often occurred in multiple variants.&lt;ref name=Gould-1852/&gt;

In 1851,&lt;ref name=Hilton-2011-a/&gt; after the fifteenth asteroid ([[15 Eunomia|Eunomia]]) had been discovered, [[Johann Franz Encke]] made a major change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the ''[[Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch]]'' (BAJ, ''Berlin Astronomical Yearbook''). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned ① to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].{{efn|Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]].}} That year Astraea's number was increased to ⑤, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilton&quot;/&gt;

== Exploration ==
{{see also|Sample return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}}
[[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]]
Until the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.&lt;ref name=AIAA_NEO_feasibility/&gt;

The first close-up photographs of asteroid-like objects were taken in 1971, when the ''[[Mariner 9]]'' probe imaged [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], the two small moons of [[Mars]], which are probably captured asteroids. These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.

The first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].

The first dedicated asteroid probe was ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'', which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.

Other asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' in 2002).

From September to November&amp;nbsp;2005, the Japanese ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' probe studied [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but [[Sample return mission|returned samples]] of its surface to Earth on 13&amp;nbsp;June 2010.

The European [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' probe]] (launched in 2004) flew by [[2867 Šteins]] in 2008 and [[21 Lutetia]], the third-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.

In September&amp;nbsp;2007, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], which orbited [[4 Vesta]] from July&amp;nbsp;2011 to September&amp;nbsp;2012, and has been orbiting the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1&amp;nbsp;Ceres]] since 2015. 4&amp;nbsp;Vesta is the second-largest asteroid visited to date.

On 13&amp;nbsp;December 2012, China's lunar orbiter ''[[Chang'e 2]]'' flew within {{cvt|2|mi|km|order=flip}} of the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]] on an extended mission.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' probe in December&amp;nbsp;2014, and plans to return samples from [[162173 Ryugu]] in December&amp;nbsp;2020.

In June&amp;nbsp;2018, the US [[National Science and Technology Council]] warned that America is unprepared for an [[Asteroid impact avoidance|asteroid impact event]], and has developed and released the ''&quot;National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy Action Plan&quot;'' to better prepare.&lt;ref name=&quot;WH-20180621&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GIZ-20180621&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICARUS-220180522&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20180614c&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bennu 330km 181029.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Bennu]]
In September&amp;nbsp;2016, NASA launched the [[OSIRIS-REx]] sample return mission to asteroid [[101955 Bennu]], which it reached in December&amp;nbsp;2018. {{As of|2019|06}}, the probe is in orbit around the asteroid.&lt;ref name=NewSci2019Jun18/&gt;

=== Planned and future missions ===
[[File:Lucy--mission-13--v3.png|thumb|Planned Lucy spacecraft]]
In early 2013, NASA announced the planning stages of a mission to capture a near-Earth asteroid and move it into lunar orbit where it could possibly be visited by astronauts and later impacted into the Moon.&lt;ref name=Wall2013Sep30/&gt; On 19&amp;nbsp;June 2014, NASA reported that asteroid [[2011 MD]] was a prime candidate for capture by a robotic mission, perhaps in the early 2020s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP-20140619&quot;/&gt;

It has been suggested that asteroids might be used as a source of materials that may be rare or exhausted on Earth ([[asteroid mining]]), or materials for constructing [[space habitat]]s ''(see [[Colonization of the asteroids]])''. Materials that are heavy and expensive to launch from Earth may someday be mined from asteroids and used for [[space manufacturing]] and construction.

In the U.S. [[Discovery program]] the [[Psyche (spacecraft)|''Psyche'' spacecraft]] proposal to [[16 Psyche]] and [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' spacecraft]] to [[Jupiter trojan]]s made it to the semi-finalist stage of mission selection.

In January&amp;nbsp;2017, ''Lucy'' and [[Psyche (spacecraft)|''Psyche'' mission]] were both selected as NASA's [[Discovery Program]] missions&amp;nbsp;13 and 14 respectively.&lt;ref name=Northon2017Jan4/&gt;

{{Main|Asteroids in fiction}}

Asteroids and the asteroid belt are a staple of science fiction stories. Asteroids play several potential roles in science fiction: as places human beings might colonize, resources for extracting minerals, hazards encountered by spacecraft traveling between two other points, and as a threat to life on Earth or other inhabited planets, dwarf planets, and natural satellites by potential impact.
