(Part of the [[Memorial Route of Jewish Martyrdom and Struggle in Warsaw]])]]

'''Paweł Frenkiel''' (sometimes also '''Frenkel''', {{lang-he|פאוול פרנקל}};
1920–1943) was a Polish Army officer and a [[Jew]]ish youth leader in Warsaw and one of the senior commanders of the [[Jewish Military Union]], or the ŻZW. Although one of the most important leaders of the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and the Jewish resistance in the months preceding April 1943, Frenkiel is also one of the least well known to historians, and both his earlier life and his ultimate fate are a subject of some controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SiM&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Various authors |editor=[[Dariusz Libionka]] |year=2007 |title=Rozmowa z Józefem Grynblattem, członkiem Betaru i Żydowskiego Związku Wojskowego w czasie powstania w getcie warszawskim |journal=Zagłada Żydów.

==Biography==
Paweł Frenkiel was born in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. At the age of 18 he joined the revisionist [[Zionism|Zionist]] youth movement [[Betar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PWN&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN|Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN]] |title=Żydowski Związek Wojskowy |url= |edition= |year=2005 |publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]] |volume= |location=Warsaw |id= |pages= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[September Campaign|German conquest of Poland]] and the start of German repressions against the Jewish population of Poland, he joined the Jewish Military Union and became one of its highest-ranking members. It is unclear what his exact capacity was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apfelbaum&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Marian Apfelbaum |editor= |others= |title=Two Flags: Return to the Warsaw Ghetto |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2007 |publisher=Gefen Publishing House |location= |isbn=9789652293565 |oclc= |pages=56, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier publications and accounts by Tadeusz Bednarczyk,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bednarczyk&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1= |editor= |others= |title=Życie codzienne warszawskiego getta; warszawskie getto i ludzie (1939-1945 i dalej) |trans-title=Everyday life of the Warsaw Ghetto: Warsaw Ghetto and its people |url= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1995 |publisher=Ojczyzna |location=Warsaw |isbn=8386449020 |oclc= |pages= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henryk Iwański]] and Kałmen Mendelson assert, that Paweł Frenkel was one of the deputies of JMU's commander [[Dawid Moryc Apfelbaum]]. However, other accounts, including those by [[Dawid Wdowiński]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Wdowiński&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Wdowinski |author2=Chaim Lazar |editor= |others=Morris Chariton |title=And we are not saved |trans-title= |edition=2 |series= |volume= |year=1985 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |isbn=0802224865 |url=https://www.amazon.ca/We-Are-Not-Saved-ebook/dp/B00XABVSG6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482385680&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=and+we+are+not+saved#reader_B00XABVSG6 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cezary Szemley suggest, that Frenkiel was indeed the leader of the entire organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apfelbaum&quot;/&gt; In recent years some historians went as far as to suggest that Apfelbaum did not even exist at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Więź&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dariusz Libionka |author2=Laurence Weinbaum |year=2007 |title=Pomnik Apfelabuma, czyli klątwa &quot;majora&quot; Iwańskiego |trans-title=Monument to Apfelbaum, or the curse of &quot;Major&quot; Iwański |journal=Więź |volume= |issue=4 |pages=100–111 |issn=0511-9405 |url= |accessdate= |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libionka&quot;/&gt;

In any way, it is probable that Paweł Frenkiel personally commanded one of the armed companies of armed fighters during the ill-fated [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943. According to a widespread opinion he was [[killed in action]] while defending the headquarters of the Jewish Military Union at #7 [[Muranów|Muranów Square]]. According to some other sources he was killed on 19 June 1943 in Grzybowska Street in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Libionka&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dariusz Libionka |author2=Laurence Weinbaum |title=Bohaterowie, hochsztaplerzy, opisywacze: wokół Żydowskiego Związku Wojskowego |trans-title=Heroes, Hucksters, Story-tellers: On the Jewish Military Union |year=2011 |publisher=Stowarzyszenie Centrum Badań nad Zagładą Żydów, [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] |location=Warsaw |isbn=9788393220281 |oclc= |pages=534–535 |language=pl}} The controversy surrounding Apfelbaum's existence discussed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stars''' is a [[computer graphics]] effect used by [[computer games]]. The effect takes the bright parts of a rendered image of the scene, and then smears them outward in a number of directions. The result is that bright areas have streaks emanating from them. Stars can be used to enhance [[Bloom (Shader Effect)|blooming]]. The effect is also sometimes known as ''light streaks'' or just as the ''star effect''.

'''Thomas Pope''' (October 6, 1825 – June 29, 1863) was a Canadian [[independent politician]] and served as the eleventh mayor of [[Quebec City]].

'''Clark Calvin Griffith''' (November 20, 1869 - October 27, 1955), nicknamed &quot;the Old Fox&quot;, was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] (1891 - 1914), [[manager (baseball)|manager]] (1901 - 1920) and team owner (1920 - 1955).

Griffith entered the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in [[1891 in sports|1891]], pitching 226 ⅓ innings and winning 14 games for the [[St. Louis Browns]] and [[Boston Reds (1890–1891)|Boston Reds]]. He began the following season with the [[Chicago Cubs|Chicago Colts]], and in [[1894 in sports|1894]] began a string of six consecutive seasons with 20 or more victories, compiling a 21-14 record and 4.92 [[earned run average|ERA]]. Griffith lowered his ERA over the following years to a low of 1.88 in [[1898 in sports|1898]], the lowest mark in the league.

Griffith won 20 games for his 7th and final time in [[1901 in sports|1901]] as a member of the [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago White Stockings]] in the nascent [[American League]]; it was also the first year he assumed managerial duties. His success extended beyond his own play as the White Stockings won the AL title with an 83-53 record.

'''''The Fascist''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il federale'''}}) is a 1961  [[Italy|Italian]] [[film]] directed by  [[Luciano Salce]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/91048/The-Fascist/overview The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was coproduced with [[France]]. It was also the first feature film scored by [[Ennio Morricone]].

== Plot ==

The movie takes place in 1944, when Italy was divided between the fascist puppet state [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana]] (controlling the northern half of the Italian &quot;boot&quot;) and the allied-occupied southern half.

Fascist bosses gathered in Cremona (in the far North of Italy and well away from the line of fire) pick enthusiast militant Primo Arcovazzi (played by [[Ugo Tognazzi]]) to take into custody professor Bonafe, a noted anti-fascist philosopher, from the rural location where he was confined in and to lead him to Rome (at the time controlled by the RSI).

Equipped with a motorcycle-sidecar combination Arcovazzi picks up the professor and heads towards the Eternal City; along the way the couple wrecks its vehicle to avoid running over a girl ([[Stefania Sandrelli]]) who turns out to be a confidence trickster and petty thief; and, after having scammed the professor out of 150 [[Italian Lira|lire]], she disappears.

Without a means of transportation Arcovazzi asks a truckload of [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers passing by to help, only to have his sidecar confiscated and be made prisoner (along with his original prisoner) by the German forces.

Ending up in a [[Nazi]]-controlled jail the couple makes good its escape thanks to an allied [[strategic bombing|air raid]], donning German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion but, while Arcovazzi is stealing a [[Schwimmwagen]] Bonafè tries to desert him.

The following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn where they rejoin the thieving girl; she is afraid but they instead ask for her help to kill a chicken they managed to steal along the way.

After having dined together the trio falls asleep; the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonafe's clothes and accessories (save for the vehicle).
Depressed by the events Arcovazzi tries to ford a stream, confiding in the Schwimmwagen's noted amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the German car sinks.&lt;br&gt;
Reaching a village on foot Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell (&quot;Casa del Fascio&quot;) where they only manage to find a couple of teenagers, armed and fanatized by fascist propaganda (which tried to mobilize even students and youngsters for its cause) who, doubting Arcovazzi's sincerity, shower him with questions only a true-blue fascist can answer.

Arcovazzi's naive enthusiasm seems to finally pay off when he answer all of the boys' questions, but the last one leaves him in dire straits (being based more on historical knowledge of the Classical world rather than the agit-prop slogans Arcovazzi is at ease with); with the two kids' fingers on the trigger it's Bonafe (being a dean of Humanities, thus knowledgeable in the subtleties of the Greek and Roman world) who comes to the rescue of his 'jailer', suggesting him the correct answer.
Confiscating a [[tandem bicycle]] and a pistol Arcovazzi is able to resume his odissey, until the former bursts a tire.

Forced on foot once again Arcovazzi decides to stop at Rocca Sabina, home of (fictitious) nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings (which he can quote verbatim) prompted him to become a fascist. Reaching the poet's house he's told by his wife that he went fighting with the Italian Army in Albania and died there. Bardacci however is still alive, having had a change of conscience, having embraced antifascism and biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses.

Arcovazzi is offered hospitality in the poet's house, where Bonafe discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise of rehabilitation for Bardacci once things settle down.

Arcovazzi however manages to catch him once again, resuming the voyage towards Rome with his &quot;captive&quot;.
Catching a methane powered pullman seems to alleviate the journey's difficulties, but during one of the frequent stops (albeit efficient, methane engines had very limited autonomy, needing many refills), Bonafe escapes for the n-th time.

Pursuing him Arcovazzi manages finally to recapture him, but the pullman is long gone...they finally manage to enter the outskirts of Rome in the dusk hours of early June, 1944.

Unbeknown to them the Italian Capital has just been conquered by the Allies. Groups of [[GI (military)|GI]]s were stationed in the squares, celebrating their victory and preserving public order. The couple is at first oblivious to the fact and manage on the way to cross roads with the young girl once again: Arcovazzi demands his clothes back but she mockingly offers him something &quot;even better&quot;, a full fascist &quot;Federale&quot; uniform. Having been promised the &quot;Federale&quot; rank if successful in his endeavor Arcovazzi eagerly accepts and dons the uniform on the spot, glowing in the regalia he so long dreamed for, while Bonafe scoffs his head.

Passing along the deserted boulevards of Rome (it's still night) they hear the laughs and jokes of a group of soldiers which Arcovazzi at first believes to be German, speaking only Italian and not being able to tell languages apart; the more cultured Bonafe points out that the men are speaking in English, prompting Arcovazzi to dismiss them as [[POW]]s (as German troops had paraded allied POWs through Rome when they contained the [[Anzio]] beachhead earlier in 1944).

But the POWs seem to be a bit too loud and relaxed and, after some inquiry, Arcovazzi is horrified at the discovery that he is, actually, behind the enemy lines (and dressed as a party boss, nonetheless).

The U.S. troops, however, treat him more as a curiosity than as an enemy, they cheer him and take pictures of him instead of shooting him on the spot (as the fascist propaganda maintained in depicting all allied soldiers as bloodthirsty brutes).

The reaction of Italian civilians, however, is wholly different; resenting the failures, the brutality and the empty boasting of fascism they throw themselves at him, menacing to [[Lynching|lynch]] him; Bonafe, who during the whole odissey has grown oddly [[Stockholm Syndrome|fond]] of him has to call on a [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] patrol to save Arcovazzi from the mob.

The [[Italian partisans|partisans]], seeing his high-rank uniform, are however inclined to shoot Arcovazzi on the spot; seeing the spirits much too inflamed to be convinced otherwise Bonafe asks for a pistol and the dubious &quot;honour&quot; of shooting his former jailer himself.

Leading the wannabe-&quot;Federale&quot; behind a ruined wall he, throws the weapon away, helps Arcovazzi in removing the uniform which was about to seal his fate and lets him go.

      <text bytes="4027" xml:space="preserve">In [[differential geometry]], a '''quaternion-Kähler symmetric space''' or '''Wolf space''' is a [[quaternion-Kähler manifold]] which, as a Riemannian manifold, is a [[Riemannian symmetric space]]. Any quaternion-Kähler symmetric space with positive Ricci curvature is [[compact space|compact]] and [[simply connected]], and is a Riemannian product of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces associated to compact [[simple Lie group]]s.

For any compact simple Lie group ''G'', there is a unique  ''G''/''H'' obtained as a quotient of ''G'' by a subgroup

:&lt;math&gt; H = K \cdot \mathrm{Sp}(1).\, &lt;/math&gt;

Here, Sp(1) is the compact form of the SL(2)-triple associated with the highest root of ''G'', and ''K'' its [[centralizer]] in ''G''. These are classified as follows.

The [[quaternion-Kähler manifold#Twistor spaces|twistor spaces]] of quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are the homogeneous holomorphic [[contact manifold]]s, classified by Boothby: they are the [[adjoint variety|adjoint varieties]] of the complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s.

These spaces can be obtained by taking a [[projectivization]] of
a minimal [[nilpotent orbit]] of the respective complex Lie group.
The holomorphic contact structure is apparent, because
the nilpotent orbits of semisimple Lie groups 
are equipped with the [[Kirillov-Kostant form|Kirillov-Kostant]] holomorphic symplectic form. This argument also explains how one
can associate a unique Wolf space to each of the simple
complex Lie groups.

The '''Gardena Ronda Express''' is a [[funicular]] situated in the [[Val Gherdëina]] near [[Santa Cristina Gherdëina]], connecting the Col Raiser lifts to the Sasslong/Ruacia and Ciampinoi lifts in northern [[Italy]].

== Trains ==
Two funiculars operate on the system. Both were built by [[Gangloff AG|Gangloff]], and the cable system was manufactured by [[Leitner Ropeways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/if-val-gardena-ronda-express-588/| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620124859/https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/if-val-gardena-ronda-express-588/| archivedate=June 20, 2018 |title=IF Val Gardena Ronda Express |website=Leitner AG }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funicular trains each have four seating cabins capable of seating around 10 and standing around 25. The total capacity is 140 people per train. The trains are {{convert|15.5|m|ftin|frac=8|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.3|m|ftin|frac=8|abbr=on}} wide, and weigh {{convert|15,500|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}.

== Track ==
The whole line runs in a tunnel, which connects two [[gondola lift]]s and through them two [[ski resort]]s.  The maximum speed is {{convert|36|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} and the slope is 100[[Per mil|‰]] (10[[%]]).  2000 persons can be transported per hour from one terminus to the other.

== History ==
Planning started in 1990 and after some changes on the track to avoid buildings, construction started in 2003. With the line's opening in 2004, after nearly forty years without a railway (the [[Val Gardena Railway]] was closed in 1960), the valley has a train again.

==Presentation==
RL syndrome is characterized by [[renal dysplasia]], [[growth retardation]], [[phocomelia]] or [[mesomelia]], radiohumeral fusion (joining of [[radius]] and [[humerus]]), [[rib]] abnormalities, anomalies of the external [[genitalia]] and potter-like [[facies]] among many others.&lt;ref name=ORPHA/&gt;&lt;ref name=orph2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/patsgn_data.php?PatId=3002&amp;PatLbl=Ulbright+hodes+syndrome&amp;Asb=Pat&amp;PHPSESSID=3ad9f6172ad44e15a75ae9d10c3983bb |title=ORPHANET - More on Ulbright-Hodes syndrome |accessdate=July 27, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==

RL syndrome is [[heredity|inherited]] in an autosomal recessive manner.&lt;ref name=rlar/&gt; This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both [[genetic carrier|carry]] one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

''Flycatcher'' was based first at [[RNAS Ludham]], [[Norfolk]] then moved to [[RAF Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop]].

On 1 April 1947 [[Kai Tak Airport]] in [[Hong Kong]] was recommissioned as HMS ''Flycatcher''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helis.com/database/go/hk_kai_tak.php Kai Tak - Helicopter Database&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, HMS FLYCATCHER, ex-Turkish motor patrol boat. Built 1912 Thornycroft. Sunk 9.11.14 by HMS ESPIEGLE in Shatt-al-Arab, salvaged, back in service late 1915. Armed with 1-6pdr/1-MG. Sold c1923.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;British Warships 1914-1919&quot; by F J Dittmar &amp; J J Colledge&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Staple''' refers to [[fiber|fibre]] of discrete length and may be of any composition.  A continuous fibre such as natural [[silk]] or synthetic is known as filament rather than staple fibre.

==Etymology==
[[Back-formation]] arising because part of the business of a [[wool-stapler]] was [[Wool classing|to sort and class]] the wool according to [[Wool measurement|quality]]. According to [[Chambers Dictionary]] the actual word &quot;staple&quot; including staple foods and other products comes from the [[Low German]] word ''Stapel'' meaning a heap of goods to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;staple, n.3&quot;. ''OED Online''. June 2011. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staple length==

Staple length, a property of staple [[fiber|fibre]], is a term referring to the average length of a group of fibres of any composition. Staple length depends on the origin of the fibres. [[Natural fibers|Natural fibres]] (such as [[cotton]] or [[wool]]) have a range of lengths in each sample, so the staple length is an average. For [[synthetic fibers|synthetic fibres]] which have been cut to a certain length, the staple length is the same for every fibre in the group. 

Staple length is an important criterion for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] fibre, as shorter fibres are more difficult to spin than longer ones, so staple length varies from short to longer length fibres, short fibers  also resulting in more hairy yarns. 

For cotton and wool, staple length was originally tested by hand, the tester removing a clump of fibre and then arranging it on a dark cloth for measurement. In the 1970s, machines were invented to do this task, taking around 5 minutes for cotton and for wool around 20 minutes. Today, machinery can take the measurement in seconds.

==Filament==
The opposite term is '''filament''' fibre, which is [[fibre]] that comes in continuous to near continuous lengths for use. [[Silk]], taken from the cocoon of a silkworm, is a filament. If filament fibre is cut into discrete lengths, it becomes staple fibre.

'''''The Narrows''''' is an American 2008 independent film starring [[Kevin Zegers]], [[Sophia Bush]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], [[Eddie Cahill]] and [[Monica Keena]].

==Plot==
The movie is based on Tim McLoughlin's novel ''Heart of the Old Country'', which has Mike Manadoro ([[Kevin Zegers]]) as a 19-year-old [[Brooklyn]] boy who is torn between two worlds. When Mike's photography portfolio wins him a partial scholarship to [[New York University]], he must figure out how to balance his tight-knit Italian neighborhood roots in [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] with the opportunity to blend into the expansive, sophisticated world on the other side of the East River. Since his job at a local car service doesn't earn him enough to make up for the rest of the tuition, and his father, a retired sanitation worker on disability, refuses out of pride to support Mike's attempts for financial aid, Mike ultimately takes a job making deliveries for Tony, the local mob boss, to make up the difference.

Mike not only has to balance work with his academic assignments, he has to manage his personal relationships as well. This includes his attraction to a beautiful, cool, intellectual young woman, Kathy Popovich ([[Sophia Bush]]) he meets at NYU, with his responsibility to his longtime girlfriend Gina ([[Monica Keena]]) from the neighborhood whom he's promised to marry. The stakes grow higher as he faces consequential choices from turning his back on all he knows and pursuing a new life.

A '''teenage tragedy song''' is a style of [[ballad]] in popular music that peaked in popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Examples of the style are also known as &quot;'''tear jerkers''',&quot; &quot;'''death discs'''&quot; or &quot;'''splatter platters'''&quot;,&lt;ref name=NPRalt&gt;{{cite web| title=Alternative Love Songs from the Teenage Tragedy Vault|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/14/466581799/alternative-love-songs-from-the-teenage-tragedy-vault|date=February 14, 2016|publisher= NPR|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other colorful sobriquets coined by DJs that then passed into vernacular as the songs became popular. Often lamenting teenage death scenarios in [[melodrama]]tic fashion, these songs were usually sung from the viewpoint of the dead person's sweetheart, as in &quot;[[Last Kiss]]&quot;&lt;ref name=LastKiss&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Kiss: The Incredible, Convoluted Story Behind This Classic #1 Hit|url=http://www.forgottenhits.com/last_kiss_the_incredible_convoluted_story_behind_this_1_classic_hit|publisher=Forgotten Hits.|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1961), or another witness to the tragedy, or the dead (or dying) person.&lt;ref name=NPRalt/&gt; Other examples include &quot;[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]]&quot; by [[Mark Dinning]] (1959), &quot;[[Tell Laura I Love Her]]&quot; by [[Ray Peterson]] (1960), &quot;[[Ebony Eyes (John D. Loudermilk song)|Ebony Eyes]]&quot; by [[the Everly Brothers]] (1961), &quot;[[Dead Man's Curve (song)|Dead Man's Curve]]&quot; by [[Jan and Dean]] (1964), and &quot;[[Leader of the Pack]]&quot; by [[the Shangri-Las]] (1964).&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;{{cite web| author=Luan Lawrenson-Woods| title=Leader of the Pack|url=http://popularromanceproject.org/leader-of-the-pack/|date= July 2, 2013|publisher= The Popular Romance Project|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre's popularity faded around 1965 (as a mostly American phenomenon, it was one of many musical formats that were drowned out by the [[British Invasion]]),&lt;ref name= Hatbox&gt;{{citation|author= Sheila Burgel|title= One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Song by Song|date= 2005|publisher= Rhino Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; but inspired a host of similar songs and parodies over the years.

==Origins and format==
By the mid-1950s, postwar youth culture in the U.S. was embracing [[rock and roll]], and the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] was also approaching its zenith &amp;ndash; the narrative style of many teenage tragedy songs had similarities to [[folk music|folk]] balladry.&lt;ref name=CNNDeathsong&gt;{{cite news|title= The teenager's death song|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/03/29/eye.ent.teensongs/index.html|author= Todd Leopold|publisher=CNN|date=March 30, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison ballads (such as [[the Kingston Trio]]'s &quot;[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]&quot;, based on a folk song about a real murder) and gunfighter ballads (such as [[Johnny Cash]]'s &quot;[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]&quot; and [[Marty Robbins]]' &quot;[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]&quot;), with similar themes of death, were also popular during the heyday of teen tragedy songs.

The teen tragedy genre's popular era began with &quot;[[Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots]]&quot;, written by [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]]. Released just before 24-year-old actor [[James Dean]]'s death in an automobile accident in the fall of 1955, it climbed the charts immediately afterward.&lt;ref name= Splatter&gt;{{cite web|title= Splatter Platters: A Look at Teenage Tragedy Songs|url= http://www.goretro.com/2013/07/splatter-platters-look-at-teenage.html|publisher=Go Retro|date=July 9, 2013|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teenage tragedies had specific thematic&lt;ref name=Zemke&gt;{{cite web|title=Genre Rules with Dr. Kirsten Zemke: 'Teenage Coffin Songs'|url=http://95bfm.com/bcasts/genre-rules-w-dr-kirsten-zemke-12/|date= November 18, 2011|publisher=95bFM, Auckland, New Zealand|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[trope (literature)|tropes]] such as [[star-crossed|star-crossed lovers]],&lt;ref name=Zemke/&gt; reckless youth, eternal devotion, suicide, and despair over lost love; along with lyrical elements that teens of the time could relate to their own lives&lt;ref name=CNNDeathsong/&gt; – such as dating, motorcycles and automobiles (car songs also being popular during the 1950s), and disapproving parents or peers.&lt;ref name=Woods /&gt;&lt;ref name=AVClub&gt;{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/screeching-tires-and-busting-glass-defining-the-teen-t-1798252265|title=Screeching tires and busting glass: Defining the teen-tragedy song in 60 minutes|last=Rife|first=Katie|website=AV Club|date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary [[girl group]]s of the '60s also borrowed the genre's melodramatic template (as well as the use of sound effects, orchestration, echo and other sonic touches) for non-fatal but otherwise tragic story-songs, such as [[Reparata and the Delrons]]' over-the-top &quot;Saturday Night Didn't Happen&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Panic&quot;, in 1968. In The Pussycats' 1966 &quot;Dressed in Black&quot;, (co-written by George 'Shadow' Morton, and originally a Shangri-Las B-side) and in &quot;We Don't Belong&quot; by UK singer Sylvan (1965), the heartbreak and melancholy are palpable – and in Sylvan's case, nearly suicidal.&lt;ref name= Hatbox /&gt;

Ethnomusicologist Kirsten Zemke considers these songs as forming a strictly musical genre that was bound by common thematic tropes, musical style and production elements; and as being of their time. As for their popularity, she writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
They sold well in their time, and the style has persisted throughout the decades in various forms. And ….they have an interesting history. The question some writers have asked is “why?”. Some of the reasons suggested for this genre’s macabre popularity are:
:These were the ultimate teen rebellion songs. The only way out of parents' (and/or societal) control and expectations was death.
:They were a natural extension of the &quot;unrequited love&quot; song, facilitated by the obvious rhyming of: good bye, cry and die.
:There were a number of publicized deaths of pop stars and young actors during that period, including [[Sam Cooke]], [[Johnny Ace]], [[Eddie Cochran]]; and of course [[The Day the Music Died|the plane crash]] that killed [[Buddy Holly]], [[Ritchie Valens]], and the [[Big Bopper]] in 1959. This might explain the interest in songs around death, tragedy and sorrow.&lt;ref name=Zemke2&gt;{{cite web| title=What the Genre?

==Deathless themes==
Teenagers meeting with tragedy in song was not new in the 1950s (or for that matter in the 1650s, around the time &quot;[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]&quot; was popular). In literature, it has been a recurring and resonant  theme over centuries, most notably in [[William Shakespeare]]'s &quot;[[Romeo and Juliet]]&quot;.  Another early example in song is &quot;[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]&quot;, published in 1884 but based on earlier songs and apparently written as a parody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5AdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |title=Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind|first=Andrew|last=Butler|date=31 October 2014|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|page=9|isbn=9781844578375|accessdate=22 March 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As popular music and the society it mirrored changed from the late 1960s onward, the themes carried on in different forms and styles. Songs and spoken-word productions about the dangers of drug abuse joined the parade of [[pathos]] on radio airwaves, ranging from three-minute morality plays to lamentations (from the parental perspective) on the [[generation gap]]. These include &quot;Once You Understand&quot; by Think (U.S. #23, 1971) and radio and TV host [[Art Linkletter]]'s [[Grammy]]-winning single &quot;We Love You, Call Collect&quot; (U.S. #42, 1969).  Recorded before his daughter Diane's apparent suicide in 1969, the record also included Diane speaking the reply, &quot;Dear Mom and Dad&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/05/26/tv-host-art-linkletter-passes-away/|title=TV Show Host Art Linkletter Dies at 97|date=2010-05-26|website=Foxnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Into the 1970s, as the [[Vietnam War]] continued, hit ballads of youth and death included [[B. J. Thomas]]' &quot;Billy and Sue&quot; (1972) and [[Terry Jacks]]' No. 1 hit &quot;[[Seasons in the Sun]]&quot; (1974), their protagonists of indeterminate age, or slightly older than teens.  A song that was thought to have referenced the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was [[Paper Lace]]'s 1974 hit &quot;[[Billy Don't Be a Hero]],&quot; made a bigger hit in the U.S. by [[Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods]]. Hard-rock acts recorded vehicular death scenarios such as &quot;[[Children's Heritage/D.O.A.|D.O.A.]]&quot; ([[Bloodrock]], 1971), &quot;[[Detroit Rock City]]&quot; ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], 1976) and &quot;[[Bat Out of Hell (song)|Bat Out of Hell]]&quot; ([[Meat Loaf]], 1977).

By the end of the 1970s, teenage tragedy would chart without the element of melodrama – in 1979, &quot;[[I Don't Like Mondays]]&quot; by the [[Boomtown Rats]], written by [[Bob Geldof]] in response to a senseless school shooting in the news while he was on tour in the U.S., went to No. 1 in the UK, and No. 4 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clarke | first=Steve | title=The Fastest Lip on Vinyl | work=[[Smash Hits]] | publisher=EMAP National Publications Ltd | date=18–31 October 1979 | pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Smiths]] 1987 song &quot;[[Girlfriend in a Coma (song)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]&quot; also took inspiration from teenage tragedy songs, by taking the melodramatic aspect and pushing it to extremes.  Some songs merely updated the sound of the previous era, such as &quot;Racing Car&quot; by Dutch group [[:nl:Air Bubble|Air Bubble]] (1976), while others used the melodic and stylistic tropes of teen tragedy in tougher, grittier settings, as in the [[Ramones]]' &quot;You're Gonna Kill That Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;7-11&quot; (1981), [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]]' &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (1999), [[Eminem]]'s &quot;[[Stan (song)|Stan]]&quot; (2000), and [[Gord Downie]]'s album ''[[Secret Path]]'' (2016).  &quot;[[Teen Idle]]&quot; by [[Marina and the Diamonds]] (2012), evoking an [[archetype]] of disenfranchised youth, is a thematic heir to the original teen tragedy oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/electra-heart-mw0002328372|title=''Electra Heart''&amp;nbsp;– Marina and the Diamonds|last=Monger|first=James Christopher|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satires and parodies==
Notable parody songs, satires and send-ups of teen tragedy over the decades have included:
* &quot;Let's Think About Living&quot; (1960), with [[Bob Luman]] mocking the then-current musical trend, trying to steer listeners away from being fascinated with the subgenre.
* “Valerie”, a 1961 [[doo-wop]] styled teen tragedy spoof by The Mark III, a young folk trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Man/Valerie 45|url= http://www.45cat.com/record/nc927137us#comments |publisher= 45cat|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;All I Have Left is Johnny's Hubcap&quot; on the 1962 parody album, ''Mad “Twists” Rock ’n’ Roll'', produced in association with ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine.
* &quot;Surfin' Tragedy&quot; (1963) by The Breakers, in which a surfer careens &quot;90 miles an hour&quot; into a [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] pier, killing him instantly. It is included on ''[[The Rhino Brothers Present the World's Worst Records]]''.
* &quot;Jenny Brown&quot;, from the 1964 [[Smothers Brothers]] album ''[[It Must Have Been Something I Said!]]'', has a melody and lyrics in the opening verses mimicking a typical &quot;dead teenager&quot; song. In the last verse, it is revealed that Jenny was playing a prank on her boyfriend.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*&quot;Leader of the Laundromat&quot; by [[the Detergents]] (1964), a direct parody of the Shangri-Las' hit, written by [[Paul Vance]] and [[Lee Pockriss]]. The Detergents were a studio group that included singer [[Ron Dante]], later of [[the Archies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Richie Unterberger]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-detergents-mn0000123391 |title=The Detergents &amp;#124; Biography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jimmy Cross]]'s &quot;I Want My Baby Back&quot; (1965), a [[novelty record]] about a fatal head-on collision with &quot;The Leader of the Pack,&quot; narrated in a down-home patter reminiscent of [[Andy Griffith]]. The single made the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] (reaching #92), and became a cult classic years later from airplay on [[Dr. Demento]]'s syndicated radio show; it is also included on the ''World's Worst Records'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Jimmy Cross: I Want My Baby Back|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJ8BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67 |author=Daryl W.

*In a 1965 episode of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', &quot;Lucy in the Music World,&quot; [[Lucille Ball]] tried to appeal to teenagers with a song about a boyfriend whose &quot;surfboard came back by itself.&quot; She had been advised that youth today &quot;aren't happy unless they're miserable.&quot;&lt;ref name= Splatter/&gt;
* &quot;[[Death Cab for Cutie (song)|Death Cab for Cutie]]&quot; by the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] (1967), the inspiration for [[Death Cab for Cutie|the band]] of the same name.
* [[Randy Newman]]'s song &quot;Lucinda&quot;, on his 1970 album ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]'', concerns a girl who falls asleep on the beach in her [[graduation]] gown, and is killed and buried by a [[Sand cleaning machine|beach cleaning machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&amp;pg=PA104 |title=Randy Newman's American Dreams|first=Kevin|last=Courrier|date=22 March 2019|page=104|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|isbn=9781550226904|accessdate=22 March 2019|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[John Entwistle]]'s &quot;Roller Skate Kate,&quot; from his 1973 album ''[[Rigor Mortis Sets In]]'', the heroine is killed while skating in the high-speed lane of the motorway.
*[[10cc]]'s 1973 song &quot;Johnny Don't Do It,&quot; done in the style of early 1960s girl-group songs, with the trope of the bad boy who is good but misunderstood. Johnny steals a motorcycle and hits a truck, killing his girlfriend along with himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/johnny-dont-do-it-lyrics-10-cc.html |title=10 Cc - Johnny Don't Do It Lyrics |website=MetroLyrics.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brian DePalma]]'s 1974 film ''[[Phantom of the Paradise]]'' satirizes the genre in musical numbers including the opening song, &quot;Goodbye Eddie Goodbye&quot; by fictional band The Juicy Fruits.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin, and Laraine Newman recorded a song for season 2 of ''Saturday Night Live'' entitled &quot;Chevy, Chevy&quot; which is a send-up of teen tragedy, presenting [[Chevy Chase]] as a teen idol.
* On ''The [[Rich Little]] Show'' of March 8, 1976, [[Tom Bosley]] and &quot;[[Welcome Back, Kotter|Sweathogs]]&quot; [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]], [[Robert Hegyes]], and [[Ron Palillo]] sang a parody of the genre called &quot;Pizza Death,&quot; in which the simple-minded driver of a pizzeria delivery van crashed, affording the by-standers an opportunity for free pizza.
* &quot;My Baby's the Star of a Driver's Ed Movie,&quot; a 1983 song by [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]].
* &quot;[[The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun]]&quot; by comedian and singer [[Julie Brown]]. Released nationally in 1984, the song (along with an accompanying video in heavy [[MTV]] rotation) was both a parody of the genre, and a satire of [[valley girl]] culture.&lt;ref name=JulieBrown&gt;{{cite web| title=The Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun - Julie Brown |url=http://dmdb.org/lyrics/homecoming.queen.html|publisher=The Demented Music Database|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000|MST3K]]'' treatment of the 1996 film ''[[Werewolf (1996 film)|Werewolf]]'' included a sketch in which Mike and the bots dressed up as a girl group sing &quot;Where, O Werewolf&quot;, about &quot;Suzy&quot; (Mike)'s doomed relationship with her werewolf boyfriend.
*&quot;Road Man&quot; by [[Smash Mouth]], in which a [[roadie]] is hit by a train while rushing to get the band's gear to a show.

The '''Comparative Tracking Index''' ('''CTI''') is used to measure the [[electrical breakdown]] (tracking) properties of an [[Electrical insulation|insulating material]]. Tracking is an electrical breakdown on the ''surface'' of an insulating material wherein an initial exposure to heat chars the material, and the char is more conductive than the original insulator, producing more current flow, more heat, and eventually complete failure.

==Details==
A large voltage difference gradually creates a conductive leakage path across the surface of the material by forming a carbonized track. Testing method is specified in IEC standard 60112.

To measure the tracking, 50 drops of 0.1% [[ammonium chloride]] solution are dropped on the material, and the voltage measured for a 3&amp;nbsp;mm thickness is considered representative of the material performance. Also term PTI (Proof Tracking Index) is used: it means voltage at which during testing on five samples the samples pass the test with no failures.

Performance Level Categories (PLC) were introduced to avoid excessive implied precision and bias.

The CTI value is used for [[electrical safety]] assessment of electrical apparatus, as for instance carried out by [[Underwriters Laboratory]] in USA and many other laboratories in the world. The minimum required [[creepage]] distances over an insulating material between electrically conducting parts in apparatus, especially between parts with a high voltage and parts that can be touched by human users, is dependent on the insulator's CTI value. Also for internal distances in an apparatus by maintaining CTI based distances, the risk of fire is reduced.

Creepage distance requirement depends on the CTI. Material which CTI is unknown are classified in IIIb group. There's no CTI requirement for glass, ceramic, and other inorganic material which don't breakdown on the surface.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The better the insulation, the higher the CTI (positive relationship). In terms of clearance, a higher CTI value means a lower minimum creepage distance required, and the closer two conductive parts can be. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1289893O/tech-brief-comparative-tracking-index-test.pdf|title=Tech Brief Comparative Tracking Index|access-date=January 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6196" xml:space="preserve">The '''Lewes Arms controversy''' was a dispute between the [[Greene King Brewery]] and the regulars of the Lewes Arms pub in [[Lewes]], [[East Sussex]], England from 2006 to April 2007, when the brewery withdrew from sale a local beer.

The dispute prompted a change in Greene King's policy that may well have repercussions for other pubs that have lost the right to sell local beers. One of the Greene King directors, Mark Angela, left the company amid a shake up of all Greene King houses in which the managed house operations were split into two divisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2007/03/26/312353/mark-angela-to-leave-greene-king-in-reorganisation.html caterersearch.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Lewes Arms.jpg|left|thumb|The Lewes Arms]]
Greene King decided to stop selling the locally produced [[Harveys (brewery)|Harvey's Sussex Best Bitter]] at the Lewes Arms in December 2006.

Harvey's brewery is approximately half a mile from the pub and is a major local employer. The 220-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lewes Arms: FRIENDS OF THE LEWES ARMS press release|url=http://lewesarms.blogspot.com/2007/01/friends-of-lewes-arms-press-release.html|publisher=lewesarms.blogspot.com|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lewesarms.blogspot.com/2007/01/friends-of-lewes-arms-press-release.html FRIENDS OF THE LEWES ARMS press release&lt;/ref&gt; pub in the centre of the town had been acquired by Greene King in 1998. The seasonal Harvey's ales were withdrawn in 2004 but the Best Bitter remained on sale because of its popularity - selling four times as much as Greene King's [[cask ale]]s. The decision to finally withdraw the Best Bitter turned into a public relations disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pub News &amp; Pub Property Search for the UK pub trade|url=http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?sectioncode=7&amp;storycode=54885&amp;c=3|website=MorningAdvertiser.co.uk|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The protest==

A petition of 1200 signatures was collected.

Following the withdrawal, the regulars of the pub staged a well-publicised [[boycott]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewesarms.blogspot.com/ LewesArms.Blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with a regular vigil outside the pub at peak times to explain the situation to casual visitors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewesarms.org.uk/ www.lewesarms.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lewesarms.blogspot.com/2007/03/lewes-arms-first-100-days.html Lewes Arms: The First 100 days]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in an estimated loss of trade of 90%.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2041086,00.html The Guardian: Last Orders.

After a 133-day boycott, a highly critical article in ''The Guardian''&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt; and a corporate reorganisation in March involving the departure of Mark Angela as the head of the managed house operations, the company announced on 20 April 2007 that it would reinstate a range of Harvey's ales at the Lewes Arms. In what ''The Independent'' described as a &quot;humiliating climbdown&quot; chief executive Rooney Anand admitted that the company had greatly underestimated the depth of feeling about its initial decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pub News &amp; Pub Property Search for the UK pub trade|url=http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?sectioncode=7&amp;storycode=55097|website=MorningAdvertiser.co.uk|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying &quot;The Lewes Arms is a very special local pub with a unique place in the life of the town ... the decision to return Harvey's to the bar is the right one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2472149.ece The Independent: Drinkers win Battle of Lewes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428191816/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article2472149.ece |date=2007-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pub is now owned by [[Fuller, Smith and Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=243&amp;itemid=373&amp;task=View Fuller's web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125100925/http://fullers.co.uk/rte.asp?id=243&amp;itemid=373&amp;task=View |date=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John George Appold - By Maull &amp; Polyblank Cropped.jpg|thumb]]'''John George Appold''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biocrawler.com/encyclopedia/Biocrawler:Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society/A  Fellows of the Royal Society]&lt;/ref&gt; (14 April 1800, in [[Shoreditch]], London – 31 August 1865, in [[Gloucestershire]]) was a British fur [[dye|dyer]] and [[engineer]]. Appold was the son of a fur-skin dyer, established in Finsbury. Succeeding to his father's business at the age of twenty-two, he introduced into it so many scientific improvements that he soon amassed a considerable fortune and was able to devote his time and attention to his favourite mechanical pursuits. His inventions, though numerous and evincing very great ingenuity, were not of the very highest class.

Perhaps the most important of them was his [[centrifugal pump]]. This procured him a 'council medal' at the [[Great Exhibition]] at [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1851, and it is highly commended in the report of the juries on that exhibition. Appold's pump with curved blades showed an efficiency of 68%, more than three times better than any of the other pumps present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortunecity.com/meltingpot/broadway/1211/id20.htm  Centrifugal impeller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227110708/http://www.fortunecity.com/meltingpot/broadway/1211/id20.htm |date=2009-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be mentioned that the medal was for the special form of pump, the principle having been known and acted upon many years before.

Another invention of considerable value was a brake, employed in laying deep-sea telegraph cables. This apparatus was used in laying the first [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|Transatlantic cable]] in 1858. Appold was very liberal in communicating his ideas to others. He was on terms of friendship with many of the chief engineers of his time, and was consulted by them frequently with advantage. He patented but few of his ideas, preferring generally to give them freely to the public. His house was a museum of mechanical contrivances, such as doors which opened at a person's approach, and shutters which closed at the touch of a spring, while the same movement turned on and lighted the gas. Probably, had he been compelled to rely for his support on his mechanical talents, his inventions would have been further developed, and have been brought more prominently into notice than they were. As it was, he was a man of high reputation among his contemporaries, who left behind him but little to keep his name from forgetfulness. He is commemorated with a memorial tablet inside [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]] and buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].

'''''The Course of Time''''' is a ten-book [[poem]] in [[blank verse]], first published in 1827.&lt;ref name=electric&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.electricscotland.com/history/other/pollok_robert.htm
| title = Significant Scots; Robert Pollok
| accessdate = 2007-05-02
| work = Electric Scotland
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last published and most famous work of Scottish poet [[Robert Pollok]]. The first edition of the poem sold 12,000 copies, and by its fourth edition it had sold 78,000 copies and become well known even in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollok himself died in September 1827, only a few months after the poem was published.

An [[Illustration|illustrated]] edition was published in 1857, featuring the work of [[John Tenniel]], [[Myles Birket Foster]], and [[Clayton and Bell|J. R. Clayton]].&lt;ref name=munlibrary/&gt;

'''David Rhys-Jones''' (born 16 June 1962) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er who played for the [[Carlton Football Club]] and the [[Sydney Swans]] in the [[VFL/AFL]]. The highlight of his 182-game career was winning the [[Norm Smith Medal]] as best on ground in Carlton's [[1987 VFL Grand Final|1987 Grand Final]] victory.

Rhys-Jones began his career with South Melbourne in 1980, which relocated north becoming the Sydney Swans in 1982. He moved back south to join Carlton in 1985 after a pay dispute. He remained with Carlton until his retirement in 1992. Rhys-Jones was a superbly balanced footballer, capable of playing in multiple positions and equally adept as a goalkicking option as he was at shutting down opponents. His nullifying of [[Dermott Brereton]] in the 1987 [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] earned Rhys-Jones the [[Norm Smith Medal]]. He was awarded nine [[Brownlow Medal]] votes that year.

But his career was not without controversy; he stood out with his blond locks and aggressive nature and, at the time of his retirement, held the record for the most tribunal appearances with 42. Rhys-Jones was charged 25 times and suspended for a total of 22 matches as well as appearing 17 times as the victim. The former AFL Chief Executive [[Andrew Demetriou]] was once reported for striking Rhys-Jones.

In 1992 Rhys-Jones was appointed captain-coach of the [[North Launceston Football Club]]. After playing his 50th game in the 1995 winning grand final team Rhys-Jones left to coach [[Frankston Football Club|Frankston]] in the [[Victorian Football Association]]. After three years of successive finals appearances, including two grand finals, Rhys-Jones quit Frankston to concentrate on media commitments.

In 2000 he was appointed coach of [[Heidelberg Football Club]]. After a run of injuries in 2001 he decided to pull on the boots himself and was quickly suspended by the [[Diamond Valley Football League|Diamond Valley league]] from playing football until 2003 and fined $3000 after assaulting an opponent. The tribunal ruling that he was not allowed on the field forced Rhys-Jones to give his quarter-time team addresses from behind the boundary line. The following year he announced in his biography that he used [[cocaine]] during his playing career.

Rhys-Jones married his second wife Cheri Donnelly in [[Queensland]] in 2001. They have a son together, Cooper, who has [[Prader-Willi Syndrome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.carltonsc.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=501 |title=Rhys Jones' boy has rare condition |access-date=1 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322213153/http://www.carltonsc.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=501 |archive-date=22 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter Madison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/soon-of-a-guns-always-hungry/story-fn7x8me2-1226115491168 Herald Sun: Family battles with Cooper's insatiable hunger]&lt;/ref&gt; Rhys-Jones and wife Cheri took over the Canada Hotel in [Melbourne Swanston st], Carlton in 2002 renaming it the Plough and Harrow Hotel. That year Rhys-Jones joined a reality show on Channel 7, called ''[[The Club (Australian reality show)|The Club]]''; and was chosen by audience votes to coach a new Australian rules football team in the [[Western Region Football League]]. The team was named the Kensington Hill Hammerheads, which Rhys-Jones coached to a premiership in its first (and only) year. Rhys-Jones has three children from his first marriage, Sharna, Molly, and Dakota. Rhys-Jones lives in Melbourne.

'''Foreign relations of the Axis powers''' includes states which were not officially members of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] but had relations with one or more Axis members.

==Europe==
=== Andorra ===
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Andorra]] remained neutral but was an important smuggling route between Vichy France and Spain.

=== Austria ===
On February 12, 1934 the new [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] regime provoked the [[Austrian Civil War]] by ordering search warrants for the headquarters of the socialist party.  At that time the socialist party structures were already weakened and the uprising of its supporters was quickly defeated. Subsequently, the socialist party and all its ancillary organisations were banned.

On May 1, 1934, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] cabinet approved a new constitution that abolished freedom of the press, established a one party system (known as &quot;The Patriotic Front&quot;) and created a total state monopoly on employer-employee relations.  This system remained in force until the [[Anschluss]] in 1938, when Austria became part of [[Nazi Germany]]. The Patriotic Front government frustrated the ambitions of Nazi sympathizers in Austria who wished both political influence and unification with Germany, leading to the assassination of Dollfuss on July 25, 1934. His successor [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] maintained the ban on Nazi activities in Austria, but was forced to resign on March 11, 1938 following a demand by Hitler for power-sharing with pro-German circles.

On March 12, German troops entered Austria, who met celebrating crowds, in order to install Nazi puppet [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] as Chancellor.  With a Nazi administration in place and the country integrated into Nazi Germany, a referendum on April 10 approved the annexation with a majority of 99.73%.

As a result, Austria ceased to exist as an independent country during World War II.  Technically, this annexation was forced by military invasion, but large parts of the Austrian population were in favour of the Nazi regime.  The large Jewish population (about 200,000 Jews were living in [[Vienna]] at that time), which had had considerable significance for science and culture at that time, was killed or forced into exile, as were many socialist and [[Catholic]] Austrian politicians.  Approximately 1.2 million Austrians either volunteered or were drafted into the [[Wehrmacht]], of which about 250,000 were killed.  Nearly 67,000 Austrians served in the Waffen SS, a disproportionately high number viz. its population compared with Germany's at the time.  Austrian troops made up the bulk of seven [[Alpine divisions]] and [[infantry]] divisions, three armoured divisions and three garrison divisions.

=== Belarus ===
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ostland}}
{{Main|Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany}}
During World War II, the Nazis attempted to establish a Belarusian [[puppet state]], led by collaborationist [[Belarusian Central Rada]], with symbols similar to the short-lived [[Democratic Republic of Belarus]]. The Germans imposed a brutal racist regime, burning down some 9,000 Belarusian villages, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands more civilians.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Almost the entire, previously very numerous, [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish population of Belarus]] that had not been evacuated, was killed. One of the first uprisings of a Jewish ghetto against the Nazis occurred in 1942 in a small Polish town of [[Łachwa Ghetto|Łachwa (now Lakhva, Belarus)]].

===Belgium===
{{Main|Rexism}}
Before the [[Battle of Belgium|occupation of Belgium]] by Germany, Belgium withdrew from its alliance with France and declared itself neutral, compromising the [[Maginot line]] in the process. King [[Leopold III of Belgium]] choose to remain in the country, rather than going into exile. Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines.

During the late 1930s through 1945, Belgium had many [[Fascist]] groups and Parties, such as [[Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond]] and many others.  Nazi Germany and Fascist groups had moved to Belgium to establish a Fascist party in Belgium.  They had some success; Belgium decided not to go with any Axis powers.

===Channel Islands===
{{Main|Occupation of the Channel Islands}}
While the German Army was preparing to land an assault force of two battalions to capture the [[Channel Islands]], a reconnaissance pilot landed in [[Guernsey]] on 30 June 1940 to whom the Island officially surrendered. Jersey surrendered on 1 July. Alderney, where no one remained, was occupied on 2 July, and a small detachment travelled from Guernsey to [[Sark]] which officially surrendered on 4 July. In Guernsey, the [[Bailiff]], Sir [[Victor Carey]] and the States of Guernsey handed overall control to the German authorities. Day-to-day running of Island affairs became the responsibility of a Controlling Committee, chaired by Ambrose Sherwill.

The policy of the Island governments, acting under instructions from the British government communicated before the occupation, was one of passive co-operation, although this has been criticised because of the deportation of Jews from the islands. Some island women fraternised with the occupying forces, although this was frowned upon by the majority of Islanders, who gave them the derogatory nickname &quot;[[Jerry (WWII)|Jerry]] bags&quot;.

===Czech Republic===
{{Main|Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czech resistance to Nazi occupation|Czechoslovak government-in-exile}}
[[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] were [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied]] and declared [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|a protectorate]] of Germany and were placed under the supervision of the [[Reichsprotektor]], which position [[List of rulers of the Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia#German Protectors|held consecutively several people]].  [[Emil Hácha]] remained as technical head of state with the title of State President; German officials manned departments analogous to cabinet ministries, while small German control offices were established locally.  The Gestapo assumed police authority. Jews were dismissed from the civil service and placed in an extralegal position.  Political parties were banned, and many democratic politicians fled to France and United Kingdom where they established anti-Nazi [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government in exile]]. Many [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] leaders fled to the Soviet Union.

The population of the protectorate was [[Totaleinsatz|mobilized for labor]] that would aid the German war effort, and special offices were organized to supervise the management of industries important to that effort.  [[Czechs]] were drafted to work in coal mines, the iron and steel industry, and armaments production; some young [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|people were sent to Germany.]]  Consumer goods production, much diminished, was largely directed toward supplying the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces]].  The protectorate's population was subjected to strict rationing.

===Denmark===
{{Main|Occupation of Denmark }}
On May 31, 1939, Denmark and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] signed a treaty of non-aggression, which did not contain any military obligations for either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/IkkeAngrebsPagt.htm|title=Den Dansk-Tyske Ikke Angrebstraktat|website=Navalhistory.dk|accessdate=1 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--don't remove this line. Germany had no legal &quot;right&quot; or claim to same to invade Denmark in 1940. The treaty merely stated that the two countries should never be at war with each other. The text does not mention the word &quot;friendship&quot; either.--&gt; On April 9, 1940, citing intended British mining of Norwegian and Danish waters as a pretext, Germany occupied both countries. King [[Christian X]] and the Danish government, worried about German bombings if they resisted occupation, accepted &quot;protection by the Reich&quot; in exchange for nominal independence under German military occupation, thereby ending the fighting in Denmark already on the day of the invasion. Three successive Prime Ministers, [[Thorvald Stauning]], [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and [[Erik Scavenius]], maintained this ''samarbejdspolitik'' (&quot;cooperation policy&quot;) of collaborating with Germany.

Denmark coordinated its foreign policy with Germany, extending diplomatic recognition to Axis collaborator and puppet regimes and breaking diplomatic relations with the &quot;governments-in-exile&quot; formed by countries occupied by Germany. Denmark broke diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] of 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trommer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Trommer, Aage |title=&quot;Denmark&quot;. The Occupation 1940-45 |publisher=[[Foreign Ministry of Denmark]] |url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-15.asp |accessdate=2006-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618002436/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-15.asp |archivedate=2006-06-18  |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, a Danish military corps, ''[[Frikorps Danmark]]'' was created at the initiative of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the [[National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark|Danish Nazi Party]], to fight alongside the ''Wehrmacht'' on Germany's [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. A government statement following the formation of the Frikorps was widely interpreted as a sanctioning of the corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lidegaard&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lidegaard  | first = Bo  | authorlink = Bo Lidegaard  | title = Dansk Udenrigspolitisk Historie, vol. 4  | publisher = [[Gyldendal (Denmark)|Gyldendal]] |location=  Copenhagen | pages= 461–463 | year = 2003  | isbn = 87-7789-093-0 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frikorps Danmark'' was open to members of the Danish Royal Army and those who had completed their service within the last ten years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldpost&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Danish Legion Military and Feldpost History |  url=http://axis101.bizland.com/DanishFeldpost.htm| accessdate=2006-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 4,000 and 10,000 Danes joined the ''Frikorps Danmark'', including 77 officers of the Royal Danish Army. An estimated 3,900 Danes died fighting for Germany during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Denmark transferred six torpedo boats to Germany in 1941, although the bulk of its navy remained under Danish command until the declaration of martial law in 1943.

Denmark supplied agricultural and industrial products to Germany as well as loans for armaments and fortifications. The German presence in Denmark, including the construction of the Danish part of the [[Atlantic Wall]] fortifications, was paid from an account in Denmark's central bank, ''[[Danmarks Nationalbank|Nationalbanken]]''. The Danish government had been promised that these expenses would be repaid later, but this never happened. The construction of the Atlantic Wall fortifications in Jutland cost 5 billion Danish kroner.

The Danish protectorate government lasted until August 29, 1943, when the cabinet resigned following a declaration of martial law by occupying German military officials. The [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish navy]] managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships to prevent their use by Germany. Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels and later to raise and refit 15 of the sunken vessels. During the scuttling of the Danish fleet, a number of vessels were ordered to attempt an escape to Swedish waters, and 13 vessels succeeded in this attempt, four of which were larger ships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinehistorie.dk/Danish/Tidslinie/Maanedsvis/08_Aug.htm Søværnets mærkedage - August&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110034554/http://www.marinehistorie.dk/Danish/Tidslinie/Maanedsvis/08_Aug.htm |date=2007-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1939_1945/dk_efter29august.htm Flåden efter 29. august 1943&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816205702/http://www.navalhistory.dk/danish/Historien/1939_1945/dk_efter29august.htm |date=August 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Larger vessels: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were at Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans.

By the autumn of 1944, Sweden raised this number to 4,800 and recognized the entire unit as a Danish military [[brigade]] in exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clausalstru4.wixsite.com/danforce-bat|title=Danforce|website=Clausalstru4.wixsaite.com|accessdate=1 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish collaboration continued on an administrative level, with the Danish bureaucracy functioning under German command.

Active resistance to the German occupation among the populace, virtually nonexistent before 1943, increased after the declaration of martial law.  The intelligence operations of the [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]] was described as &quot;second to none&quot; by [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery]] after the liberation of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.befrielsen1945.dk/temaer/befrielsen/jubel/index.html|title=Jubel og glæde|date=28 October 2005|website=Befrielsen1945.dk|accessdate=1 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonia===
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ostland}}
{{Main|Occupation of Estonia by Nazi Germany}}
After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped for restored independence but it soon became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied &quot;Ostland&quot;. A [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (secret police) was established for internal security under the leadership of [[Ain-Ervin Mere]].

A conscript [[Waffen-SS]] Estonian unit that eventually became a full-sized Waffen-SS division, the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)]], was formed in 1944. The Estonian units saw action defending the [[Narva]] line throughout 1944.

{{Main|History of the Jews in Estonia}}
Estonia had a Jewish population of 4,300 people before the war. Most of the Jews were deported to [[Siberia]] along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that a few thousand Estonian Jews suffered this fate.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Out the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, 950 Jews were caught by the Nazis.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite book|author=Estonian State Commission on Examination of Policies of Repression|url=http://www.just.ee/orb.aw/class=file/action=preview/id=12709/TheWhiteBook.pdf|publisher=Estonian Encyclopedia Publishers|title=The White Book: Losses inflicted on the Estonian nation by occupation regimes. 1940–1991|year=2005|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114130824/http://www.just.ee/orb.aw/class%3Dfile/action%3Dpreview/id%3D12709/TheWhiteBook.pdf|archivedate=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Round-ups and killings of Jews began immediately following the arrival of the first German troops in 1941, who were closely followed by the extermination squad [[Sonderkommando 1a]], part of Einsatzgruppe A.

===France===
{{Main|Munich Agreement}}
Before the [[Battle of France]], France had signed the Munich Agreement which would allow Hungary and Nazi Germany, 2 Axis powers, and [[Poland]], an allied power which also had a relationship, to take over [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938.

===Greece===
{{Main|Axis occupation of Greece during World War II}}
Despite the fact that the vast majority of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece's]] leaders, clerics, population, military, and persons on both left and right political spectrum resisted the Italian, German, and Bulgarian occupation, a small group of sympathizers, including the puppet governments of the [[Quisling]] Prime Ministers [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]] and [[Ioannis Rallis]] emerged. From 1941 to 1944 the collaborationist governments and sympathizers comprising the infamous &quot;Security Battalions&quot; (Greek: Ταγματασφαλίτες, Tagmatasfaletes) fought against the guerrilla forces of both the rightist and leftist factions of the [[Greek Resistance]]. These were widely reviled in colloquial Greek as Germanotsoliades (Greek: Γερμανοτσολιάδες, literally meaning &quot;German Tsolias&quot;).

=== Ireland ===
{{Main|The Emergency (Ireland)}}
[[Éire]], as the Republic of Ireland was known at the time, was officially neutral during the war. [[Northern Ireland]] was part of the United Kingdom.  In 1939–40, Germany attempted to infiltrate spies into the UK by way of Éire, but these attempts consistently failed (see [[Operation Lobster]] and [[Operation Seagull]]).

During the period 1939–43, German intelligence, the ''[[Abwehr]]'' made attempts to foster intelligence-gathering links with the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), but found that the IRA was in no condition to be of serious use.  IRA members such as [[Francis Stuart]] did travel to Germany for discussions, although these were largely ineffectual.

The German military also drew up plans detailing how an invasion of Ireland might take place.  These plans were titled [[Operation Green (Ireland)|Plan Green]] and any invasion was to act as a diversionary attack in support of a main attack to conquer Britain titled [[Operation Sea Lion]].  Both of these plans were shelved by 1942.  Germans also came to Ireland, the most notable of whom was [[Hermann Görtz]], who was captured in possession of &quot;[[Plan Kathleen]]&quot; &amp;mdash; an IRA plan that detailed a Nazi supported invasion of Northern Ireland.

On the occasion of the [[death of Adolf Hitler]], Irish ''[[Taoiseach]]'' (Prime Minister) [[Éamon de Valera]] paid a controversial visit to German ambassador [[Eduard Hempel]] to express sympathy with the German people over the death of the Führer.

A few Irish people served in German forces; for example James Brady and Frank Stringer served in {{Lang|de|SS-Jagdverband Mitte}} during 1944-1945 and were court-martialed and imprisoned after the war. And a third person, Patrick O’Neill, an Irish doctor, may have served in SS-Sturmbataillon 500.

Conversely more than 40,000 Irish fought alongside the British during the war &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/Irish-Regiments-in-the-World-Wars_9781846030154/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831072510/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/Irish-Regiments-in-the-World-Wars_9781846030154 |archive-date=2009-08-31 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the youngest ever [[RAF]] [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] in history [[Fighter ace]] [[Paddy Finucane]].  Éire produced British [[materiel]] under contract and was bombed during the war by the [[Luftwaffe]] in the [[Bombing of Dublin in World War II]] despite Éire's neutral status.  Fear of the British [[Plan W]] for a re-invasion of Ireland spurred Irish preparations for defence of the island against the possibility of a German or British attack.  Later in the war when the threat of a British invasion subsided The Irish government allowed RAF planes to fly the [[Donegal Corridor]] beginning in 1941.  This was a contravention of Irish neutrality and was thus not publicised at the time.

Ireland ended World War II as one of only five (non micro-state) European Countries to [[Neutral powers during World War II|avoid entering the war]].

=== Latvia ===
{{Main|Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany|Reichskommissariat Ostland|Latvian Legion}}
German troops occupied [[Riga]] on July 1, 1941. Immediately after the installment of German authority, a process of eliminating the Jewish and [[Romani people|Roma]] population began, with many killings taking place in [[Rumbula, Riga|Rumbula]]. The killings were committed by the Einsatzgruppe A, the Wehrmacht and Marines (in [[Liepaja]]), as well as by Latvian collaborators, including the 500–1,500 members of the infamous [[Arajs Commando|Arājs Commando]], which alone killed around 26,000 Jews, and the 2,000 or more Latvian members of the SD. By the end of 1941 almost the entire Jewish population was killed or placed in the death camps. In addition, some 25,000 Jews were transported to Latvia from Germany, Austria and the present-day Czech Republic, of whom around 20,000 were killed. [[The Holocaust]] claimed approximately 85,000 lives in Latvia.

===Liechtenstein===
According to some sources [[List of princes of Liechtenstein|Prince]] [[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz I]] of [[Liechtenstein]] &amp;mdash; the [[absolute monarch]] of the small principality &amp;mdash; was antipathetic to Nazism because his consort, [[Elisabeth von Gutmann|Elisabeth]] ([[née]] von Gutmann), was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,759431-2,00.html ''Time'' (magazine), &quot;Nazi Pressure?&quot; (April 11, 1938)]. Access date: April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Franz I died in 1938 and was succeeded by [[Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Franz Joseph II]]. Liechtenstein remained neutral throughout World War II, and its neutrality was never violated by any of the combatants.  However, two factors have linked the Liechtensteinian state to the Axis cause:

In 2005, it was revealed that Franz Josef II profited directly from the Holocaust. Labourers from the [[Strasshof an der Nordbahn|Strasshof]] [[concentration camp]], provided by the ''SS'', had worked on estates in Austria owned by the Liechtensteinian royal house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4443809.stm BBC, &quot;Nazi crimes taint Liechtenstein&quot; 14 April, 2005] Access date: April 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The family also bought property in Austria and Czechoslovakia which had been taken from Jews by the Nazis.

At the end of the war, Liechtenstein gave [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to about 500 soldiers of the [[First Russian National Army]], which had been recruited by the German Wehrmacht from Soviet POWs.

=== Lithuania ===
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ostland}}
After the German invasion, Lithuanians soon realized that the Nazis had no plans for an independent or even autonomous [[Lithuania]] and, in fact, they viewed the natives as second-class citizens. Lithuania lost its independence completely, and economic conditions were harsh, especially in cities and towns (in villages people were at least able to grow food for themselves).

There was substantial cooperation between the German forces and some Lithuanians. The [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] group formed five police companies to assist in the occupation the country. Later, the units around [[Kaunas]] were incorporated into the Tautos Darbo Apsauga (National Labour Guard) and in [[Vilnius]] the Lietuvos Savisaugos Dalys (Lithuanian Self Defence).  These were then joined into the Policiniai Batalionai (Lithuanian Police Battalions) called by the Germans the Schutzmannschaft, with a total of 8,388 men by August 1942.  Another infamous unit was the [[Lithuanian Secret Police]] (Saugumo policija).  Despite the fact that the purpose of their creation was different, these Lithuanian units participated in the Holocaust, especially within Lithuania (including the areas of Vilnius region that are now in [[Belarus]]).

=== Monaco ===
While Prince [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Louis II]] was strongly sympathetic to the [[France|French]] and later the [[Free French]], he tried to keep [[Monaco]] neutral during World War II but supported the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] government of his old army colleague, Marshal Philippe Pétain.  Nonetheless, his tiny principality was tormented by domestic conflict partly as a result of Louis’ indecisiveness, and also because the majority of the population was of Italian descent; many of them supported the fascist regime of Italy's Benito Mussolini.

In 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, setting up a fascist puppet government.  Soon after, following Mussolini's fall in Italy, the German Army occupied Monaco and began the deportation of the Jewish population.  Among them was [[René Blum (ballet)|René Blum]], founder of the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo|Opera]], who died in a Nazi concentration camp.  Under Prince Louis’ secret orders, the Monaco police, often at great risk to themselves, warned people in advance that the Gestapo was planning on arresting them. The country was liberated as German troops retreated.

===Poland===
{{Main|Munich Agreement}}
Poland never accepted any offer of cooperation with the Axis, but it did claim [[Zaolzie|a part of Czechoslovakia]] when the country was dissolved by two Central European Axis powers, [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] in 1938. However, this action stemmed from an earlier [[Czechoslovak-Polish border dispute (1918-1947)|border dispute]], not from any ideological alignment with the Axis.

===Portugal===
{{Main|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}
[[António de Oliveira Salazar]], the dictator of [[Portugal]], was personally sympathetic to the Axis, but Portugal and the United Kingdom were bound by the world's oldest defence treaty, the [[Treaty of Windsor 1386|Treaty of Windsor]]. After the UK invoked the treaty, a major Allied air and naval base was established in the [[Azores]]. Portugal, particularly [[Lisbon]], was one of the last European exit points to the US, and a huge number of refugees found shelter in Portugal. Siding with the Axis would have meant that Portugal would have been at war with the United Kingdom, which would have threatened Portuguese Asian and African colonies, while siding with the Allies might prove to be a threat to Portugal itself, resulting in unrestricted submarine warfare and possibly even invasion if the pro-German Spain had joined the Axis. Portugal continued to export [[tungsten]] and other goods to both the Axis (partly via Switzerland) and Allied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reginbogin, Herbert R 2009&quot;&gt;Reginbogin, Herbert R. and Detlev F. Vagts, ''Faces of neutrality: a comparative analysis of the neutrality of Switzerland and other Neutral nations during World War II'', (Transaction Publishers, 2009), 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal protested the occupation of [[Portuguese Timor]] by [[Australian]] forces in 1942, but did not actively resist. The colony was subsequently occupied by Japan. Timorese and Portuguese civilians assisted Allied [[commando]]s in [[Battle of Timor (1942-43)|resisting the Japanese]]. Portuguese [[Macau]] was not occupied by Japan unlike its neighbouring Hong Kong, and Portugal ended World War II one of the five (non micro-state) European countries that managed to avoid [[Neutral powers during World War II|entering the war]].

===San Marino===
[[San Marino]] was officially neutral in World War II. It was sympathetic to the Axis because it was ruled by the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]].  However, German forces (the 993rd [[Panzergrenadier]] Regiment) retreated through the country in 1944 and were pursued by Allied forces ([[4th Indian Division]]). The Allied military forces remained only as long as militarily necessary which was only a few weeks. In all, the fighting killed about 60 inhabitants of San Marino.

===Soviet Union===
Relations between the Soviet Union and the major Axis powers were generally hostile before 1939. In the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Soviet Union gave military aid to the [[Second Spanish Republic]], against [[Spanish State|Spanish Nationalist]] forces, which were assisted by Germany and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. However the Nationalist forces were victorious. In 1938 and 1939, the USSR fought and defeated Japan in two separate border wars, at [[Battle of Lake Khasan|Lake Khasan]] and [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. The Soviets suffered another political defeat when an ally, Czechoslovakia, [[Munich Agreement|was partitioned and partially annexed]], by Germany, Hungary and Poland—with the agreement of Britain and France—in 1938–39.

There were talks between Soviet Union and United Kingdom and France for an alliance against the growing power of Germany but these talks failed.  As a result, on August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which included a secret protocol whereby the independent countries of Finland, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], Poland and Romania were divided into [[spheres of interest]] of the parties.

On September 1, barely a week after the pact had been signed, the partition of Poland commenced with [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|the German invasion]]. The Soviet Union [[Invasion of Poland (1939)#Phase 2: Soviet aggression|invaded Poland from the east]] on September 17.

Soon after that, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of Baltic Republics|occupied]] Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in addition, it annexed [[Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] from Romania. The Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939 which started the [[Winter War]]. Finnish defence prevented a complete occupation of the country, but Finland was forced to cede strategically important border areas near [[Leningrad]].

The Soviet Union supported Germany in the war effort against Western Europe through the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]] with [[export]]s of [[raw materials]] ([[phosphates]], [[chromium]] and [[iron ore]], [[mineral oil]], [[cereal|grain]], [[cotton]], [[rubber]]). These and other export goods were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories and thereby circumvented the British naval blockade of Germany. The Soviet Union also aided the Nazis by setting up a naval base near Murmansk in support of Hitler's [[Battle of the Atlantic|U-boat war]] against Britain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Lure of Nepture: German-Soviet Naval Collaboration and Ambitions, 1919–1941&quot;, Tobias R. Philibin III, ''Europe-Asia Studies'', Vol. 48, No. 4 (Jun., 1996), pp. 685–686&lt;/ref&gt; Germany ended the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by invading the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] on June 22, 1941. This resulted in the Soviet Union becoming one of the main members of [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].

Germany then revived its [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] enlisting many European and [[Asia]]n countries in opposition to the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union and Japan remained neutral towards each other for most of the war per agreement in the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]]. In the weeks before a declaration of war, Japan was actively lobbying The Soviet Union to appeal to the western allies in hopes of achieving more favorable surrender conditions. The Soviet Union ended the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|by invading Manchukuo]] on August 8, 1945, days before the ultimate [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese capitulation]], and the end of World War II.

===Spain===
{{Main|Spain in World War II}}
[[Francisco Franco|''Generalísimo'' Francisco Franco's]] [[Spain under Franco|Spanish State]] gave moral, [[war economy|economic]], and military assistance to the Axis powers, while nominally maintaining [[neutral country|neutrality]]. Franco described Spain as a &quot;nonbelligerent&quot; member of the Axis and signed the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1941 with Hitler and Mussolini.

Franco had won the [[Spanish Civil War]] with the help of Germany and Italy.  Spain owed Germany over $212 million for supplies of [[matériel]] during the Spanish Civil War, and Italian combat troops had actually fought in Spain on the side of Franco.

When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Franco immediately offered to form a unit of military volunteers to join the invasion. This was accepted by Hitler and, within two weeks, there were more than enough volunteers to form a division—the [[Blue Division]] (''División Azul'' in Spanish) under General [[Agustín Muñoz Grandes]].

Additionally, over 100,000 Spanish civilian workers were sent to Germany to help maintain industrial production to free up able bodied German men for military service.

Despite strong pro-Axis leanings, Spain managed to end World War II as one of only five (non micro-state) European countries to [[Neutral powers during World War II|avoid entering the war]].

===Sweden===
Perhaps the most important aspect of [[Sweden|Sweden's]] relations with Nazi Germany before and during the Second World War was the [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|extensive export of iron ore]] to be used in the German arms industry. As Germany's preparations for war became more apparent and the risk of another war became obvious, international interest in Swedish ore increased. Germany attempted to pressure Sweden into increasing their ore exports, but without success. However, relations between Germany and Sweden remained co-operative, as Sweden continued its exports off the record. In addition to iron ore, Germany required SKF Swedish ball bearings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reginbogin, Herbert R 2009&quot;/&gt;

Already during the [[Norwegian campaign]] the [[Swedish Government]] gave the Wehrmacht access to the Swedish rail system, allowing the Germans to transfer 60 soldiers under the guise of red-cross personnel from the occupied areas in Southern Norway to the fighting at the [[Battle of Narvik|Narvik front]]. Access to the Swedish railways was later granted on condition that the number of German soldiers travelling to occupied Norway would balance the number leaving (in practice this limitation would be ignored). Sweden also allowed German naval transports to take shortcuts across Swedish [[territorial waters]] in the [[Baltic Sea]].

The most controversial [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (WWII)|transit of German troops through Sweden]] was that of a fully armed and equipped infantry division under the command of [[Erwin Engelbrecht]] from Norway to Finland during the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. (see also [[Per Albin Hansson#The 1941 .22Midsummer Crisis.22]])

Responding to German appeals for volunteers, between 130 and 300 Swedish citizens enlisted in the German Armed Forces (most of them served in the [[Waffen-SS]]) and saw combat on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=58  Swedish Volunteers in the German Wehrmacht in WWII] feldgrau.com&lt;/ref&gt; This was a choice made by individual Swedish citizens, and not Swedish government policy (foreign recruitment of volunteers was banned in Sweden). Some 1,600 Swedes served legally as volunteers during the [[Continuation War]], where Finland fought on the side of the Axis against the Soviet Union. About 400 of this group consisted of regular officers on leave from the [[Swedish Army]].

Despite all this, Sweden managed to survive World War II as one of only five (non micro-state) European nations to [[Neutral powers during World War II|avoid entering the war]].

===Switzerland===
During World War II, the [[Swiss franc]] was the only remaining major freely convertible currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the [[Swiss National Bank]]. Between 1940 and 1945, the German [[Reichsbank]] sold 1.3 billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency. Hundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was monetary gold plundered from the central banks of occupied countries. 581,000 francs of &quot;Melmer&quot; gold taken from Holocaust victims in Eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks.

Switzerland, despite being 70% ethnic German ([[Alemanni]]c—other ethnic groups included 19% [[French people|French]], 10% [[Italian people|Italian]], and 1% [[Rhaeto-Romansch people|Rhaeto-Romansch]]) was determined to remain neutral during the war.  The country had several distinct defensive advantages that could help make any incursions into its territory very difficult.  Firstly, it is shaped rather like a bowl, with high mountains surrounding and making up its borders with neighbouring countries.  There were only four passes by which an army could make an entrance, and the Swiss had already mined every railway tunnel with explosives.  Any incursions by the Germans or Italians would be met by a sealed border.  Secondly, the Swiss also maintained a very large reserve army—all able bodied men were not only required to serve their time, backed up by regular training—but were required to keep their military equipment in their own homes, to be ready to report to duty within 48 hours of callup.  The Germans themselves estimated that any attack on Switzerland would likely result in a 4:1 casualty ratio against them.

Not that the Swiss went untested: in May 1940, Luftwaffe aircraft flew into Swiss airspace to attack French targets behind the lines and to test the Swiss response.  Swiss-built [[Messerschmitt 109]]s hurtled into squadrons of German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers and shot many of them down.  The German pilots had assumed the ME109s to be German and took no evasive action at first, until they’d been pounced on.  There were several other engagements between German and Swiss aircraft during the war. The Swiss also built the French-designed [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] under license. As for the Allies, American and British bombers occasionally strayed over Swiss territory earning potshots from Swiss antiaircraft units or being escorted to the nearest runway by Swiss aircraft for impoundment.  As sympathies for either side were to be found everywhere in Switzerland, how German or Allied aircrews were treated when apprehended depended on the sympathies of the captors.  Some were beaten and kept in camps, others given a considerable amount of freedom.

Switzerland ended World War II as one of only five (non-microstate) European nations to [[Neutral powers during World War II|avoid entering the war]].

=== Turkey ===
Nazi Germany had no intention of occupying [[Turkey]], even though its neighbors to the west were all occupied by the Axis (including Greece, while Bulgaria was allied with Germany). [[Franz von Papen]], the German foreign minister, visited Ankara with hopes of persuading Turkey to join the Axis powers. This would have significantly shortened the Axis route through the [[Caucasus]] to the valuable Soviet oil fields in [[Baku]].  As it turned out, by 1942 the German Army was almost on Turkey's eastern doorstep, only a few miles from the Soviet-Turkish border as they pushed down into the Caucasus.  However, the Soviet victory at [[Stalingrad]] and subsequent [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] defeats caused the Germans to withdraw from the area.

Turkey decided to remain neutral so as not to alienate the Allies, however it also signed a neutrality pact with Germany. It also shipped chromium, a vital element in the production of planes, tanks and U-boats, to Nazi Germany until the Turkish declaration of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reginbogin, Herbert R 2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Albert, ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs'', (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1970), 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey was the last country during wartime to purchase military equipment from Germany, ([[Panzer III]]-[[Panzer IV|IV]]s, [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]As, etc.).  The Turks also purchased weapons from the Allies ([[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]]s, [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s).

Turkey, however did declare war on Germany at the very end of the conflict as a means of being allowed to join the postwar [[United Nations]].

=== Ukraine ===
{{Main|Reichskommissariat Ukraine}}
During World War II, some elements of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] nationalist underground fought both the German and Soviet forces, forming the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] in 1942, while other Ukrainians initially collaborated with the Nazis, having been ignored by all other powers. In 1941 the German invaders and their Axis allies initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the Red Army.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Initially, the Germans were received as liberators by many Ukrainians, especially in Western Ukraine which had only been occupied by the Soviet forces in 1939.  However, German rule in the occupied territories eventually aided the Soviet cause. Nazi officials of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population of Ukrainian territories’ dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Germans preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, deported others (mainly Ukrainians and Poles) to work in Germany, and began a systematic depopulation of Ukraine to prepare it for German colonization.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, during the late 1920s and 1930s, there were some individuals and political groups that sympathized with Fascism. They included [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]] (British Fascists), [[Arnold Leese]] (Imperial Fascist League), [[Oswald Mosley]] (British Union of Fascists), [[William Joyce]] and [[John Beckett (politician)|John Beckett]] (National Socialist League), among others.

In 1938 a few western countries, including the UK signed the [[Munich Agreement]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. In this agreement Nazi Germany received a strategically important part from [[Czechoslovakia]]. This was criticised by many, including the [[USSR]]. This territory was important for Germany and it allowed Germany to be encircled by the Western Powers.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Müller, Deutschland. Sechster Teil (München and Berlin: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 1943), pp. 116-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Far East in the same period certain individuals such as [[Reginald Johnston]] ([[Puyi|Puyi's]] tutor), Brigade General F.H. Burnell-Nugent (chief of the British embassy guards in Tien-Tsin), among others supported the Japanese plans related to the [[Mukden Incident]], the creation of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] and the open Japanese intervention in Northeast China.

During the war some British POWs served in &quot;[[British Free Corps]]&quot; (Legion Of Saint George) organised in January 1943, conceived by [[John Amery]], son of [[Leopold Stennett Amery]]. [[Heinrich Himmler]] was interested in the concept and ordered more volunteers to be recruited, but only approximately 30 soldiers volunteered for this unit (including 3 Canadian, 3 Australians, 3 South Africans and 1 New Zealander). The unit never saw any action, but a few men from this unit are believed to have fought in the [[Battle of Berlin]].

===Vatican City===
The [[Roman Question]] was solved on February 11, 1929 between the [[Holy See]] and the Kingdom of Italy. The treaty was signed by Benito Mussolini and [[Pietro Cardinal Gasparri]] in behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922–1939), respectively.  The [[Lateran Treaty]] and the [[Concordat]] established the independent State of the Vatican City and granted Catholicism a special status in Italy.

The Holy See was one of few states that established diplomatic relations with the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Smith| first = Norman| title = Resisting Manchukuo: Chinese Women Writers and the Japanese Occupation| publisher = University of Washington Press| year = 2007| isbn =0-7748-1335-0|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia===
[[Chetniks]] of [[Draža Mihajlović]] were recognized as a member of the Allies, but instead of fighting against Germans and Italians, they collaborated with them in a struggle against [[Yugoslavian partisans]].

==Asia==

===Afghanistan===
In [[Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] under the tutelage of his uncles and one of his cousins invited and received industrial support from Germany. By 1935, German engineers and businessmen had developed factories and hydroelectric projects within Afghanistan. Minor support from Japan and Italy was also expected.

Although Afghanistan declared their neutrality on August 17, 1940, the British and Soviets were still alarmed by the large number of German non-diplomatic personnel within the country. In October, both British and Soviet governments ordered that Afghanistan remove all Axis non-diplomatic personnel from the country.  The Shah and his tutors regarded the demands as insulting and illegitimate, but they had taken note of the swift invasion of Iran conducted in August. Not wanting the same thing to happen to their country, they accepted the demands and began practicing absolute neutrality.

===China===
{{Main|Sino-German cooperation (1911–1941)}}
China enjoyed cordial relations with Germany after World War I, because Germany lost its colonial holdings in China with its defeat.  China demanded German industrial expertise, while Germany saw China as a large market.

With the ascent of the Nazis in Germany in 1933, Germany entered intense cooperation with China, as the Nazis required Chinese raw materials for its planned economy, while [[Chiang Kai-shek]] sought German advice in reforming the military to resist the Japanese and the Communists.  At the height of this cooperation, Sino-German exchange accounted for 17% of China's foreign trade and China was the third largest trading partner with Germany.

The cooperation of Nationalist China and Nazi Germany declined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, as Germany favoured Japan, its Anti-Comintern Pact ally, as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.  Contacts persisted for some time, until July 1941, when Nazi Germany recognized the Japanese puppet [[Wang Jingwei Government]], extinguishing ties with Chiang's government.  Nationalist China formally declared war on Japan and Nazi Germany on December 9, 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

===First Republic of Eastern Turkestan===
The Turkish-Islamic [[First East Turkestan Republic]] had some links to the Axis Powers, because during 1930-37 the Axis wanted to exploit Pan-[[Islamic]] sentiments to create a pro-Axis [[client state]] in [[Central Asia]] as a way of checking Soviet influence in the area.

===Indonesia===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of Indonesia}}
During the occupation, the Japanese encouraged and backed Indonesian nationalistic feeling, created new Indonesian institutions and promoted nationalist leaders such as [[Sukarno]]. In the decades before the war, the Dutch had been overwhelmingly successful in suppressing the small nationalist movement in Indonesia so the Japanese proved fundamental in preparing the coming Indonesian independence.

The Japanese regime perceived [[Java]] as the most politically sophisticated, but economically the least important area; its people were Japan's main resource.  As such—and in contrast to Dutch suppression—the Japanese encouraged Indonesian nationalism in Java and thus increased its political sophistication (similar encouragement of nationalism in strategic resource-rich Sumatra came later, but only after it was clear the Japanese would lose the war).  The outer islands under naval control, however, were regarded as politically backward but economically vital for the Japanese war effort, and these regions were governed the most oppressively of all.  These experiences and subsequent differences in nationalistic politicisation would have profound impacts on the course of the Indonesian Revolution in the years immediately following independence (1945–1950).

In addition to revived Indonesian nationalism, equally important for the coming
independence struggle and internal revolution was the Japanese orchestrated economic, political and social dismantling and destruction of the Dutch [[colonialism|colonial state]].

In early 1929, during the so-called Indonesian National Revival, Sukarno and fellow Indonesian nationalist leader [[Mohammad Hatta]] (later [[Vice President of Indonesia|Vice President]]), first foresaw a war in the Pacific and the opportunity that a Japanese advance on Indonesia might present for the Indonesian independence cause. In February 1942 Imperial Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies quickly over-running outmatched Dutch forces who marched, bussed and trucked Sukarno three hundred kilometres to [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], [[Sumatra]].  They intended on keeping him prisoner, but abruptly abandoned him to save themselves.

The Japanese had their own files on Sukarno and approached him with respect wanting to use him to organise and pacify the Indonesians. Sukarno on the other hand wanted to use the Japanese to free Indonesia: &quot;The Lord be praised, God showed me the way; in that valley of the [[Ngarai]] I said: Yes, Independent Indonesia can only be achieved with [[Dai Nippon]]...For the first time in all my life, I saw myself in the mirror of Asia.

Subsequently, indigenous forces across both Sumatra and Java aided the Japanese against the Dutch, but would not cooperate in the supply of the aviation fuel which was essential for the Japanese war effort. Desperate for local support in supplying the volatile cargo, Japan now brought Sukarno back to [[Jakarta]]. He helped the Japanese in obtaining its aviation fuel and labor conscripts, called sukarela in Indonesian and [[Romusha]] in Japanese.  Sukarno was lastingly ashamed of his role with the romusha.  He also was involved with [[PETA (Indonesia)|PETA]] and [[Heiho]] (Javanese volunteer army troops) via speeches broadcast on the Japanese radio and loud speaker networks across Java.  By mid-1945 these units numbered around two million, and were preparing to defeat any Allied forces sent to re-take Java.

On November 10, 1943 Sukarno was decorated by the Emperor of Japan in [[Tokyo]]. He also became head of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPK), the Japanese-organized committee established as the initial stage of the establishment of independence for the area under the control of the Japanese 16th Army.{{sfn|Kusuma &amp; Elson|2011|p=196}} On 7 September 1944, with the war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister [[Koiso Kuniaki]] promised independence for Indonesia, although no date was set.{{sfn|Inomata|1952|p=100}} This announcement was seen as immense vindication for Sukarno's collaboration with the Japanese.

===Iran===
{{Main|Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran}}
Following [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany's invasion of the USSR]] in June 1941, the United Kingdom and the [[Soviet Union]] became allies. Although a neutral nation, [[Reza Shah|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] had brought [[Iran]] closer to Germany.  This concerned the British who feared that the [[Abadan]] [[Abadan Refinery|Oil Refinery]], owned by the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company|Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], might fall into German hands — the refinery produced eight million tons of oil in 1940 and was thus a crucial part of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort. For the Soviets, Iran was a country of extreme strategic importance. The German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was steadily advancing through the Soviet Union and there were few ways for the Allies to get desperately needed [[United States|American]] [[Lend-Lease]] supplies to the Soviets.

In 1941 the Soviets and British jointly invaded Iran to prevent the Shah from joining the Axis orbit as neighbouring [[Iraq]] had done.  Despite having an army of 125,000 men, the Iranians were poorly trained and led, and taken by surprise. Most units quickly surrendered. Conversely, the [[Imperial Iranian Navy]], although tiny, did fight back fiercely against British naval units until quickly overwhelmed.  [[Reza Shah|The Shah]] abdicated and his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlevi]], was kept in Allied custody until war's end.

For the rest of the war, Iran was a vital source of oil for the allies, and an important supply route for the Soviets.  Many [[Poland|Polish]] emigres, initially captured by the Soviets in 1939 were released via Iran.  Thousands of Iranians became extremely valuable labourers for the allies, driving trucks and providing supplies vital to the war effort.

=== Macau ===
Following the [[Battle of Hong Kong|surrender of Hong Kong]] in December 1941, the Japanese decided not to formally occupy the Portuguese colony of [[Macau]]. The reason may have been that the Japanese respected Portuguese neutrality, but Japanese troops went in and out of Macau at will with little protest from Portuguese authorities. However, in spite of this situation, the Allied flags were allowed to be displayed in Macau at their respective consulates.

After August 1943, Japanese influence in Macau increased after they attacked and captured a British cargo ship, the [[Sian (ship)|Sian]] (or Xi'an), off the coast of Macau after killing 20 of its crew. The ship might have been carrying contraband war supplies for Nationalist Chinese Forces. It was after this incident that Japan ordered the government of Macau to accept Japanese &quot;advisors&quot; as an alternative to complete military occupation. Later, Japan became even more aggressive in ordering the [[Governor of Macau]], Commander [[Gabriel Mauricio Teixeira]], to recognize Japanese authority in [[Northern and southern China|South China]].  Furthermore, Japanese authorities ordered Portuguese troops to leave their barracks on [[Lappa Island]], an island adjacent to Macau.  The Japanese were also given the authority to conduct house-to-house searches.

Macau remained almost completely isolated from the outside world, but was never occupied by the Japanese forces during World War II. It remained neutral during the war, but was essentially out of contact with the Portuguese government in Lisbon. This prevented either reinforcement or withdrawal. The biggest problems facing the colonial authorities of Macau were caused by Chinese civilians taking refuge from the Japanese. Shortly after Portugal made the [[Azores]] available to Allied aircraft, a Portuguese [[gunboat]] docked in Macau was seized by the Japanese and renamed ''Maiko''. At the end of World War II, after the Japanese surrender, Macau returned to its previous normality.

===Tibet===
Tibet's economic and foreign policy was influenced by Japan, and Japan sought admission of Tibet into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

==Americas==
===Argentina===
[[File:Ramoncastillo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Ramón Castillo, President of Argentina, 1942–1943.]]
During the early years of World War II, [[Argentina]] maintained close relations with the Axis powers while officially remaining neutral. These close relations with the Axis irritated the United States, which cancelled weapons shipments to the country while increasing shipments to Argentina's neighbour, [[Brazil]], in an attempt to pressure the Argentine government to abandon its ties with the Axis. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=169}} Newly elected president [[Ramón Castillo]] drew Argentina closer to the Axis; in 1942 Argentina approached Germany with a request to purchase airplanes, weapons, and other equipment. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=170}} Argentine General Domingo Martínez claimed that President Castillo was concerned over the country's relations with Brazil, with Argentina facing an ultimatum from the US. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=170}} The Argentine government feared a potential invasion by Brazil, Chile and Uruguay backed by the US. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=172}} Castillo was initially determined to resist, and openly joined the Axis, believing that Argentina's geography would allow it to withstand war. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=171}} Upon Brazil joining the Allied powers in August 1942, Argentina declared itself a non-belligerent, while still negotiating with Germany for weapons. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=172}} Castillo believed that the Axis would triumph in World War II. {{sfn|Potash|1969|p=179}}

In 1943 a military coup overthrew the Argentine government. A military junta was established, led by [[Pedro Pablo Ramírez]]. In 1944 the United States government labeled the Argentine government as &quot;fascist&quot; and enacted financial and trade restrictions against the country, urging other countries to do the same. {{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=94}} British officials captured Argentina's envoy to Germany, creating a diplomatic disaster for Argentina. {{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=95}} In January 1944, under pressure from Britain and the United States, Ramírez agreed to break all ties with the Axis powers. {{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=95}} Argentine nationalists were alarmed by this concession and forced Ramírez to resign. {{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=95}} For the remaining year of the war, the United States continued to maintain sanctions against Argentina due to its pro-Axis leanings. {{sfn|Lewis|2001|p=95}} Argentina only declared war on Germany in 1945, about a month before the end of the war.

The close ties between Argentina and Nazi Germany proved controversial near the end of the war and afterwards, as Nazi personnel and capital began to arrive in Argentina in 1944.{{sfn|Walters|2009|pp=109–110}}

===Bolivia and Peru===
[[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]] during the 1930s had some commercial links with Germany and Italy; these countries acquired a number of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 44]] Stieglitz, [[Junkers Ju 86]]Ks, Junkers K 43s, and [[L3/33|CV-33]] [[tankette]]s, as well as other military and civilian equipment in first case, and examples of [[Caproni Ca.135|Caproni-Bergamaschi Ca.135]] P.XI (Ca.135bis) in the latter case.

===Brazil===
[[Brazil]], before and during the war, had commercial ties with Germany and Italy; for example, the country acquired German aircraft and weapons including [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] B-1s, Focke-Wulf Fw 58 Weihes, Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz, [[Junkers Ju 86]]Ks, [[L3/33|CV-33]] [[tankette]]s, [[Sd.Kfz. 6]]s, [[Sd.Kfz. 7]]s, and [[Sd.Kfz. 8]]s armoured vehicles. Brazil also acquired licenses for manufacturing some of these aircraft.

The Brazilian government of [[Getúlio Vargas]] was a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian dictatorship]] of fascist inspiration. Brazil's biggest economic partner at the time was [[Nazi German]]y, which was admired by many members of the government and the Armed Forces. Brazil's relations with Germany were so strong that, along with its strategic position in the Atlantic and its abundance of natural resources, the country was invited to officially join the [[Axis powers]] in 1937, to which it was denied fearing blockades and even an American invasion.

Before and the during war, there were some Brazilian political groups with native Fascist doctrines like the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralist Action]]. The country as a whole declared war on the Axis in 1942 and sent the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] to fight with the Allies in Europe.

===Canada===
Canada, though it entered the war in 1939 and was one of the first nations to declare war on the Axis, had a Fascist movement throughout the 1930s through to 1940.

The [[Parti national social chrétien]] (known in English as the '''Christian National Socialist Party''') was a Quebec-based fascist and anti-semite party founded in February 1934. The party was  led by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Adrien Arcand]]. An admirer of Adolf Hitler, Arcand referred to himself as the &quot;Canadian führer&quot;.In October 1934, the party merged with the '''Canadian Nationalist Party''', which was based in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]]. In June 1938, it merged with Nazi and other racist clubs in [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]],  many of which were known as ''[[Swastika]] clubs'', to form the '''National Unity Party''' at a national convention held in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760011,00.html Fascist Meet], ''Time Magazine'', July 18, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

The only Fascist politician ever elected in Canada was [[Peter M. Campbell]] of [[Alberta]], who won [[Lethbridge (provincial electoral district)|Lethbridge]] in the 1937 Alberta election and formed the [[Alberta Unity Party]].

However, all the parties were banned  on May 30, 1940 under the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] of the [[War Measures Act]], and Arcand and many of his followers were arrested and detained for the duration of the war.

===Chile===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}

Chile despite orbit revolve more direct U.S. influence, maintained a neutral position throughout most of the development of this confrontation. However, when the defeat of the Axis was almost accomplished, due to international pressure Chile became part of the Allies and ended up declaring war on Germany, Italy and Japan. Chile only diplomatically participated in the war as not sent troops to the battlefield. Paradoxically, Chile to be belligerent to the Allied cause, was part of the countries that in 1945 gave birth to the United Nations (UN).

===Costa Rica, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic===
Before the creation of the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]] mutual defence pact in July 1940 and entry into the war on the [[Allies of World War II#Pan American Union|Allied]] side after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] offered [[diplomatic recognition]] of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] which was not recognized as a legitimate [[Sovereign state|state]] by a majority of the world's [[nation]]s at the time, including the United States.

===Mexico===
Mexico officially did not join the Axis and declined [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] offers to take the Axis side during World War II. However, there were some Mexican citizens linked to the Spanish Fascist Party.

Some Mexican volunteers had helped [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], but the Mexican state opposed the Nationalists in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], the President of Mexico at the time, entered World War II on the Allied side late in the war.

===United States===
Officially, the United States did not favour any Axis member, but prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, there were some American businessmen linked with Japanese commerce and supporters of the Japanese cause in the country. For example, the 1939 Commerce Agreement permitted [[Thomas W. Lamont|Thomas Lamont]] (from [[J.P.Morgan]] and [[Warranty Trust Company]]) to visit Japan and establish business with Count Aisuke Kabayama (of the Iron Manufacture Company of Japan), Fuji Fujizawa (charged with collecting scrap iron in United States) and Noburo Ohtani (President of N.Y.K. Lines) among others.

One supporter was [[George Bronson Rea]], a former railway engineer and expert on Chinese affairs who in 1935 published &quot;The Case for Manchukuo&quot; (D. Appletone Century Co. New York), where he argued in favor of the Japanese protection of the [[Manchukuo]] [[puppet state]].

During the war a few US [[POW]]s became members of the German armed forces, but no unit organized of American volunteers were ever raised. Five US citizens served in the Waffen-SS in May 1940; among them were Martin James Monti (from St Louis), an SS Untersturmführer and Peter Delaney (aka Pierre de la Ney du Vair) (from Louisiana), SS-Haupsturmführer in Waffen-SS; both served in [[SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers|SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers unit]], and Delaney is believed to later have served in the Légion des Volontaires Français (LVF). He met Monti and probably arranged for him to enter the Waffen-SS; Delaney was killed in 1945. Another eight American volunteers are known to have been killed in German service.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
In the early 1930s, German immigrant, medical doctor, [[World War I]] veteran of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] and father of former South Australian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] politician, [[Heini Becker]], Dr. Johannes Becker set up the Nazi Party in Australia. Based in [[Tanunda, South Australia]], he became the leading Nazi Party organiser for Australia, gathering around a number of people, including a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor. Becker lost favour with the Nazi officials in Germany and was expelled from the party in 1941. Within the first few days of World War II, all members were interned as they were considered a risk to national security. Becker was labeled &quot;Australia's No. 1 Nazi&quot; and his organisation was known as ''The Hitler Club'' by Australian security operatives.&lt;ref&gt;Gumpl, Gary &amp; Kleinig, Richard ''The Hitler Club: The Rise and Fall of Australia's No. 1 Nazi'' Brolga Publishing Pty Ltd (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; A very small number of Australians were also believed to be recruited into the [[British Free Corps]]. Australia also produced its own fascist organisation, known as the [[Australia First Movement]]. Although not directly linked to Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy or Japan, it believed that greater links with the Axis nations would benefit Australia's long term interests. Unlike other right-wing organisations founded in Australia in the 1930s (such as the [[New Guard]]), which were essentially monarchist and pro-British Empire, the Australia First Movement was unique in that it proposed that the country become a republic as a future form of government.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

===Western Samoa===
In the 1930s the former [[German Samoa|German colony]] of Western Samoa was under New Zealand Administration. On January 15, 1934, Mr. [[Alfred Matthes]] and [[E.W. Bohle]] were authorized to establish a short-lived branch of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party in [[Western Samoa]]. Following this, they began to receive literature and printed propaganda from the Auslandsabteilung (Foreign Branch) of the Nazi Party in [[Hamburg]].

On January 20, 1937, Matthes and Gerhard Stoeicht returned to [[Apia]] from the Nazi Party's World Congress organized in Hamburg, Germany. In the same year the German consul in [[Wellington]] visited the Nazi HQ in Apia. During the [[Sudetenland#Sudeten Crisis and German annexation|Sudeten crisis]] in 1938 the local Nazis became active again and apparently planned to seize some key government institutions. Later, Matthes went broke and Berlin dissolved the Samoan Nazi Party in April 1939.

Some documents that were found in Germany after the war proved that twelve Western Samoans had official NSDAP membership cards. Ten of them emigrated to New Zealand after the war.
