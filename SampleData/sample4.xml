'''Club Boca Río Gallegos''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[sports club]] from the city of [[Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz]]. Although other sports are practised (such as [[basketball]], [[field hockey]] or [[taekwondo]]), the club is mostly known for its [[association football|football]] team, which currently plays in the [[Liga de fútbol Sur (Río Gallegos)|Liga de fútbol Sur]], the regionalised 6th level of [[Argentine football league system]].

==History==
[[File:Bocariogallegos 50s.jpg|thumb|left|250px|First team of Boca during the 1950s.]]
The first step in the foundation of Club Boca was given by a group of enthusiastic meat processing plant workers, who decided to join themselves and create a football team in the city of Río Gallegos. But this wouldn't be totally fulfilled until October 12, 1945, which settled down as the official date of foundation of the institution.

On 1988 Boca participated in the Torneo Regional (organized by [[Asociación del Fútbol Argentino]]) for the first time. Boca was allowed to play after the teams which had finished first, second and third in the last tournament, declined to participate in the next edition. Boca had finished 4th and therefore could come into the tournament filling the vacant place.

That team was coached by Jacinto Cáceres, who had managed before a well-remembered team of [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] during the Torneo Regional played in 1982. Boca would be soon nicknamed &quot;Boca Coraje&quot; (Courage Boca) due to the Club assumed the compromise of being representing the city of Río Gallegos, having formed a competitive team before the time limit for the beginning of the competition, otherwise they couldn't have played the tournament.

The first championship won by Boca was obtained on October 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bocariogallegos.com.ar/dblog/historia.asp Historia de Boca de Río Gallegos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912125033/http://bocariogallegos.com.ar/dblog/historia.asp |date=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Locust Valley, Pennsylvania''' was a village located in the southeastern corner of [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] at the southern end of [[Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=upper%20saucon%20pa#map=15/40.4963/-75.4042&lt;/ref&gt; It developed around the crossroad of what is today, Locust Valley Road and Blue Church Road South.

This area is bordered by [[Springfield Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Springfield Township]] and [[Milford Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Milford Township]] in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County, PA]] along with [[Lower Milford Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lower Milford Township]] in Lehigh County.

George W. Foering planted (in the mid-1800s) an avenue of [[locust tree]]s, thus the village name, Locust Valley. Locust trees are still prevalent in the area, including those on the Locust Valley [[golf course]].

Over time, Locust Valley lost its distinction as a village and now is part of the [[Coopersburg, PA]] mailing address.

== History of Settlement ==
This land was part of the area called [[Lenapehoking]] by the [[Lenape]] native people that inhabited it prior to the arrival of European settlers. The Unami were the specific division of the Lenape locally and they referred to this area as ''The Valley Watered by Many Springs.''

[[William Penn]] founded the colony of [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] in 1681 and this area was part of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], one of the three original counties created by Penn in 1682. The Lenape people were pushed farther west by the subsequent purchase of land by William Penn. A purchase in 1732 further secured the area of the Lehigh Valley.

German immigrants settled the Locust Valley area around 1735 calling it ''Die Gass'' (the valley). The local immigrants formally organized this area as [[Upper Saucon Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Upper Saucon Township]] in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uppersaucon.org/township-info/history/&lt;/ref&gt; At the founding of the township, Locust Valley was one of the 5 villages in the township, the others being [[Center Valley, Pennsylvania|Centre Valley]], Friedensville, Spring Valley and [[Colesville, Pennsylvania|Colesville]]. Then, in 1752, this area became part of newly created [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]]. Since 1812, when Northampton County was divided into two, Locust Valley has been located in [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania|Lehigh County]].

Warrants were given to the original settlers for purchase of plots of land. The first one in the Locust Valley area was given to Henry Rumfield in 1736 (tract #12). The plot (#14) warranted to George Morsteller in 1737 encompassed the hub of Locust Valley. Subsequent warrants (in chronological order) were given to John Adam Stout (#96), George Bachman (#11 &amp; #97), George Bastian (#13), Cornelius Crump (#98), Jacob Weaver (#100), Leonard Boydelman (#142), Jacob Bachman (#143), and Peter Cortz (#144).

During the American Revolution, George Bachman was one of the residents that was imprisoned, banished and all of his property confiscated because he was reluctant to bear arms.

== Commerce ==
The village developed around an [[iron mill]] (P. Weaver Foundry&lt;ref name = &quot;map&quot;&gt;Aschbach, G. A. ''Map of Lehigh County''. (1862).  https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3823l.la000766/&lt;/ref&gt;) that is located near the [[River source|headwaters]] of Laurel Run (South Branch of the [[Saucon Creek]]&lt;ref&gt;http://sauconcreekwatershed.org/images/maps/Assessment_Reaches.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;). Laurel Run&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fish.state.pa.us/fishpub/summary/troutregs_se.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011045556/http://www.fish.state.pa.us/fishpub/summary/troutregs_se.htm |archive-date=2014-10-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a regulated trout stream in Pennsylvania.  The [[mill race]] can still be seen as part of [http://www.locustvalleyclub.com/ Locust Valley Golf Course].

The village was once home to a post office, store (1870&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment-Home/Assessment-Direct/PIN/642302056837/PAR/1/handshake/92C43C17-974A-45F5-8090-224744361AC9&lt;/ref&gt;) (W. Trumbaur Store&lt;ref name = &quot;map&quot; /&gt;), hotel, school, and tavern.&lt;ref name = &quot;map&quot; /&gt; A tannery was still in operation in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mathews |first1=Alfred |last2=Hungerford |first2=Austin N. |title=History of the Counties of Lehigh and Carbon, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |date=1884 |publisher=Everts &amp; Richards |page=439 |url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=bibliogroup:%22History+of+the+Counties+of+Lehigh+and+Carbon,+in+the+Commonwealth+of+Pennsylvania%22&amp;source=gbs_metadata_r&amp;cad=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An official road that ran from Locust Valley to Lanark opened in 1750.

In 1910, Frank G. Hartman and his brother-in-law, Harvey Hersh (who lived in Locust Valley), opened a foundry and machine shop called Hersh &amp; Hartman. Frank brought twenty years of experience working at [[Bethlehem Steel|Bethlehem Steel Co.]], having worked there since age 16, into this new venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles Rhoads |last=Roberts |first2=John Baer |last2=Stoudt |first3=Thomas H. |last3=Krick |first4=William Joseph |last4=Dietrich |title=History of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and a Genealogical and Biographical Record of Its Families |volume=II |date=1914 |publisher=Lehigh Valley publishing Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzQPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA506 |page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Locust Valley [[Post Office]] was established on February 4, 1863. It was run by Peter Weaver out of the building (1832&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment-Home/Assessment-Direct/PIN/642302232033/PAR/1/handshake/92C43C17-974A-45F5-8090-224744361AC9&lt;/ref&gt;) on the southwest corner of the village crossroads. This continued until [[Rural Free Delivery]] service was initiated.&lt;ref&gt;Upper Saucon Township – A Bicentennial Tribute 1743 – 1976 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Locust Valley Country Club was granted a charter and opened on Memorial Day as a 9 hole private club. The 1806, 16 room [[fieldstone]] house and 125 acre property (which now spans Bucks and Lehigh Counties) was purchased from the Donald Smith estate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uppersaucon.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/UpperSauconHistory.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  William F. Gordon was the designer of the course.&lt;ref&gt;https://asgca.org/architect/wfgordon/&lt;/ref&gt;  He also designed one of the courses at [[Saucon Valley Country Club]]. In 1985, Locust Valley became a public course. Baseball legends [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Brooks Robinson]] and [[Bobby Thomson]] and Pro Football Hall of Famer [[Chuck Bednarik]] played in a tournament in 1986.  [[Arnold Palmer]] was known to practice at Locust Valley since his first wife, Winnie Walzer, was from Coopersburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/sports/golf/mc-spt-locut-valley-golf-course-closing-date-20191030-4dtna22yhzhmlghck7ysbbelju-story.html|title=Last chance to play Locust Valley: Popular golf course open until April 2020|last=Wogenrich|first=Mark|website=mcall.com|access-date=2019-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original 1806 home was razed in 2017.

== Schools ==
[[File:Locust Valley Schoolhouse 2019.jpg|thumb|2019 photo of the Locust Valley Schoolhouse built in 1880]]
A one-room schoolhouse was first opened in 1850 two years after the township adopted the [[common school]] system. The school was about one-half mile directly north on what is now Blue Church Rd South. Prior to this, students were educated in private homes or churches (there was a school at the Blue Church, for example). The education was conducted in German exclusively until about 1800, before beginning to transition toward English.

Replacing the first building, a new schoolhouse was opened in 1880&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment-Home/Assessment-Direct/PIN/641393470006/PAR/1/handshake/92C43C17-974A-45F5-8090-224744361AC9&lt;/ref&gt; with a tower and bell being added in 1902. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://mcall.newspapers.com/image/274818061&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, the school was furnished with a blackboard, globe and patent desks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mathews |first1=Alfred |last2=Hungerford |first2=Austin N. |title=History of the Counties of Lehigh and Carbon, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania |date=1884 |publisher=Everts &amp; Richards |page=433 |url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=bibliogroup:%22History+of+the+Counties+of+Lehigh+and+Carbon,+in+the+Commonwealth+of+Pennsylvania%22&amp;source=gbs_metadata_r&amp;cad=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This school operated until 1941 when the district became more centralized and children were bused to larger community schools. In 1946, there were 3 buses serving the township, and the Locust Valley students were transported to the Lanark School (the other township school being the Center Valley School (1940)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment-Home/Assessment-Direct/PIN/642415065746/PAR/1/handshake/92C43C17-974A-45F5-8090-224744361AC9&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;http://mcall.newspapers.com/image/275190367 The Morning Call August 28, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; The Lanark School was built in 1941 and was located in the northern part of the township, on the east side of Rt 309.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment-Home/Assessment-Direct/PIN/641532835329/PAR/1/handshake/92C43C17-974A-45F5-8090-224744361AC9&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently a [https://www.flblaw.com/ law firm] has occupied the building with an address of Schoolhouse Lane.

The Locust Valley schoolhouse was auctioned off and remodeled into a residence.&lt;ref&gt;http://mcall.newspapers.com/image/279872836 Morning Call December 3, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; This building is still in existence as a residential home at the intersection of Blue Church Rd S and Beverly Hills Rd.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Assessment/SearchRecords&lt;/ref&gt;

As time went along, before there were local junior and senior high schools, those that wanted further schooling would attend the schools in Allentown. Later, the local school district was developed into the [[Southern Lehigh School District]].

== Churches ==
Worship would have initially been conducted in homes or other gathering spots before specific structures were built.  The first designated building for worship was the [[Mennonites|Mennonite]] meetinghouse in Coopersburg, built about 1738.

The next church constructed within the Upper Saucon area was St. Paul's Blue Church. The first church, built of logs, was in use by 1742. Later, the Friedens church, the Mennonite Brethren in Christ church, the English Methodist church and the Free Methodist churches were constructed.

== Notable Inhabitants ==
George Washington Foering (1812-1880) settled in Locust Valley about 1839. His home was on the north side of Locust Valley Rd east of Blue Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot; /&gt; Mr. Foering was instrumental in the development of the Friedensville Zinc mines and was active politically. Being a supporter of [[James Buchanan]] for president, Mr. Foering welcomed Buchanan as a visitor in Locust Valley. A supporter of [[Abraham Lincoln]], Mr. Foering worked in Washington, DC during his administration and also assisted in various ways to enlist volunteers for the Union, including speaking throughout Lehigh County. He is buried in the Blue Church (Woodlands) cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles Rhoads |last=Roberts |first2=John Baer |last2=Stoudt |first3=Thomas H. |last3=Krick |first4=William Joseph |last4=Dietrich |title=History of Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, and a Genealogical and Biographical Record of Its Families |volume=II |date=1914 |publisher=Lehigh Valley publishing Company |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzQPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA369 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135336053/george-w_-foering&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Werb.&quot; of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' found the film to be a &quot;modest imitation&quot; of American styled romantic adventure films, noting &quot;fine photography, sets, costuming and music&quot; but that &quot;screenplay is one of the major flaws but it is difficult to determine whether vet Italo writer Ennio De Concini and director Duccio Tessari are responsible or whether fault is with collaborators Brian Degas and Tudor Gates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety-book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Variety's Film Reviews 1968-1970|volume=12|publisher=R.

When we first met, his wife [[Gena Rowlands]] came too. He introduced me to her as &quot;the 
most intelligent  director in Europe&quot; which she responded with &quot;Give him time!&quot;{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=15}} Both De Martino and Cassavetes argued on the set but according to De Martino, the two ended production on good terms.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=15}}

''Roma come Chicago'' was shot at De Laurentiis studios and on location in Rome.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=14}} Director [[Alberto De Martino]] discussed the films location as an &quot;Americanized Rome&quot;.{{sfn|Curti|2013|p=15}}

==Reception==
A review in the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' stated that the film was a &quot;fairly literal imitation of the American location thrillers of the Foties and Fifties made by Hathaway, Siodmak and others, except that it is a little more calculated in its violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mfb&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Roma come Chicago (Bandits in Rome)|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|pages=58|volume=37|issue=434|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|date=March 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ariel''-class gunboat''' was a class of nine 4-gun composite gunboats built for the [[Royal Navy]] between 1871 and 1873.  Although most were sold by 1890, one of them survived into the 1920s as a salvage vessel in private ownership.  They were the first class of Royal Navy gunboat built of composite construction, that is, with iron keel, stem and stern posts, and iron framing, but planked with wood.

==Design and construction==
Designed by [[Edward James Reed|Sir Edward Reed]], [[Director of Naval Construction|Chief Constructor]] of the Royal Navy, the ''Ariel''-class gunboats were the first Royal Navy gunboats of composite construction.&lt;ref name=gunboat&gt;Preston (2007) p.160&lt;/ref&gt;  They were some of the first vessels to be fitted with compound-expansion engines, allowing the Royal Navy to experiment with new engine designs at little risk in small, cheap vessels.&lt;ref name=gunboat/&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;''Swinger'', uniquely in the class, was engined by [[Humphrys, Tennant &amp; Co.]] with a horizontal single-expansion steam engine.&lt;/ref&gt; These engines were rated 60 [[Horsepower#Nominal horsepower|nominal horsepower]] (an [[Horsepower#Indicated horsepower|indicated horsepower]] of between {{convert|461|ihp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|534|ihp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}}).  They were armed with two {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} 64-pounder (56cwt) muzzle-loading rifles and two {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} 20-pounder Armstrong breech loaders.  All 4 guns were mounted on traversing carriages.  Some of the class were re-armed in the 1880s with two [[BL 5 inch gun Mk I – V|5-inch]] and two [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk I – VI|4-inch]] breech loaders.  All the ships of the class carried a three-masted [[barquentine]] rig.&lt;ref name=RW/&gt;

'''Artcell''' is a Bangladeshi [[progressive metal]] band formed in October 1999 by vocalist and riff guitarist George Lincoln D'Costa, lead guitarist Ershad Zaman, bassist Saef Al Nazi Cezanne and drummer Kazi Sazzadul Asheqeen Shaju. Since 1999, they have released only two studio albums and also have appeared in some mixed albums. The four original members of the band remained together until Ershad Zaman left the band in 2017 due to his personal disagreement. They pronounced Kazi Faisal Ahmed as their permanent lead guitarist on 11 November 2018.&lt;ref name=bracrev&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===Formation and Early Days (1999-2000)===
Prior to forming the band, the four founding members were school friends from [[Dhaka]], and used to get together to play [[Metallica]] songs. Eventually, Ershad came up with compositions of his own and the group began to play them at shows. The positive response they received led them to the formation of a band. What started off as an [[underground band]] is now one of the most recognised mainstream bands in the [[Bengali people|Bengali]] metal music scene.&lt;ref name=bracrev/&gt;

The name &quot;Artcell&quot; was decided upon because it was softer sounding than a typical heavy metal name. In Cézanne and Shaju's words:

{{Blockquote|Even though we were a heavy metal band when we started, we didn't want a heavy metal name. We wanted a softer or an artistic touch to the heavy metal side. 'Cells where art is produced' – that was pretty much the basic idea behind the name 'Artcell.' Ershad came up with it and we all opted for it.}}

=== &quot;অন্য সময় (Onno Somoy)&quot; (2000–2002) ===
Artcell released their first studio album ''[[Onno Shomoy|অন্য সময় (Other Time)]]'' in 2002 by [[G-Series (record label)|G-Series]]. It was both critically and commercially successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;tartareandesire&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title= – Artcell – Heavy metal band from Bangladesh
|website=Tartarean Desire
|access-date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band lost its main songwriter Rupok to [[Malaria|cerebral malaria]] while working on this album. The album was dedicated to him. One of the songs was titled &quot;রুপক একটি গান (Rupok A Song)&quot; in his memory.

=== &quot;অনিকেত প্রান্তর (Oniket Prantor)&quot; (2002–2006) ===
After the success of ''[[Onno Shomoy|অন্য সময়]]'', Artcell spent four years carrying out experiments with their music without releasing an album. They did, however, release singles scattered in various albums by other bands or [[compilation albums]]. Their second studio album &quot;Aniket Prantor (No man's land)&quot; was released in April 2006. The album was one of the top sellers of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tartareandesire&quot; /&gt;

&quot;Aniket Prantor (No man's land)&quot;, the album's namesake, is Artcell's longest song to date, at 16 minutes and 21 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 9 January 2012, Artcell announced the release of their third album and confirmed that it would be released by the end of the year. They posted on their Facebook page: &quot;This is to inform all Artcell fans and friends who have been waiting for our 3rd album, wait just for a few more months and Hopefully you won't be disappointed. In addition Artcell is also getting ready with some special releases...Music, videos and communication contents. So, look forward to a year full of activities. Thank you all again for your love and support. You guys are our true strength. Thank you&quot;.

Artcell worked on their third album in 2013.

They played in &quot;Rocknation Overload&quot; on 19 April 2014 after a break of around two years.

Cézanne and Shaju, two of the founding members, have not been active with the band for a long time. They only work with the band when they come to Bangladesh. The official Artcell website says that both of them have settled in Sydney, Australia, for family reasons. Ershad And Lincoln are presently running the band themselves with guest members.

In 2016, Artcell released their new music video &quot;Obimrishshota&quot; from their third album ''Otriteeyo'' with the original band lineup. After almost 10 years their new song had been released, written by their new lyricist Ishtiak. Both Cézanne and Shaju remain in Sydney, but they participated in the album work. Cézanne recently said in an interview that he is planning to be back in the country soon.

In the 17 years since its inception, the band has released two albums. Their third album was scheduled to be released in December 2016. Initially scheduled for a 2012 release, it is widely speculated that the delay is due to Cézanne and Shaju's inactivity, and to Ershad and Lincoln's busy schedule.

'''{{lowercase}}iPrEx''' (from {{lang-es|Iniciativa Profilaxis Pre-Exposición}}, &quot;[[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] initiative&quot;) was a phase III [[clinical trial]] to determine whether the [[antiretroviral]] medication [[emtricitabine/tenofovir]] (as [[tenofovir disoproxil|tenofovir disoproxil fumarate]]) could safely and effectively prevent [[HIV]] acquisition through sex in men who have sex with men and transgender women.  iPrEx was the first human study of an HIV prevention strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=iPrEx OLE |url=http://www.iprexole.com/1pages/prep/prep-whatistheiprexstudy.php |title=What is the iPrEx study? |accessdate=1 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study began in 2007 at four study sites in [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]], following three years of extensive community and stakeholder consultation. In 2008 the study expanded to seven additional sites in [[Brazil]], [[South Africa]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]].

==Study sponsors==
iPrEx was sponsored by the US [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) through a grant to the Gladstone Institutes, a non-profit independent research organization affiliated to the [[University of California at San Francisco]]. Additional support for the conduct of the study was provided by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00458393?term=iprex&amp;rank=2). Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Study medication was donated by [[Gilead Sciences]] Inc.

==Study design==
iPrEx was an interventional double-blind, placebo controlled trial of the safety and efficacy of the once-daily antiretroviral medication emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) as pre-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of HIV acquisition in sexually active gay and bisexual men and transgender women who have sex with men.

The study enrolled 2,499 HIV uninfected participants at 11 study sites in six countries on four continents. These participants attended monthly visits to receive a bottle of study medication with supply for 30 days.  Half of the study participants received an experimental PrEP pill (Truvada) and the other half received [[placebo]].

Participants also received additional HIV prevention services to help reduce their risk of contracting HIV.  These included [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]], [[safer sex]] counseling, treatment of [[sexually transmitted infections]] and provision of [[condoms]].

==Study results==
The iPrEx study started in June 2007 and concluded in February 2011.  Preliminary study results were published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' on 23 November 2010.  Participants were followed for a median of 21 months.  The average age of study participants was 24.

Of the 2,499 participants, 1,251 were randomly assigned to Truvada and 1,248 were assigned to take the placebo tablet (sugar pill).  There were 36 HIV infections among the participants who were offered Truvada and 64 among those offered placebo, meaning that Truvada PrEP provided 44% additional protection against HIV in this group.  This efficacy analysis (a modified [[intention-to-treat analysis]]) includes those study participants who received active study drug but who did not take it regularly enough for the drug to have any protective effect.

Protection against HIV infection was significantly higher among iPrEx study participants who took the drug regularly enough to have detectable drug concentrations in their systems, as measured through [[blood analysis]].  Among participants whose blood analyses indicated that they took PrEP 7 days a week, HIV acquisition risk was reduced by 99%. Among those who took the drug 4 days a week, the risk of HIV acquisition was reduced by 96%.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, PL, Emtricitabine-Tenofovir Concentrations and Pre-Exposrue Prophylaxis Efficacy in Men Who Have Sex with Men (12 September 2012) (http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/151/151ra125.full.html) Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the positive results, the study expanded to follow up participants for 72 weeks in an open label extension phase (see iPrEx OLE, below).

==Response to results==

===Popular media===

===CDC interim guidance===
In January 2011, the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] and Prevention issued interim guidance for the provision of PrEP to prevent sexual acquisition of HIV among men who have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;CDC Interim Guidance on HIV PrEP for Men Who Have Sex with Men (https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2011/PrEPMSMGuidanceGraphic.html) Retrieved 30 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Truvada is the only PrEP to have been tested
* PrEP is only for the HIV-negative
* PrEP is an additional defense against HIV alongside other options including the following:
**Use condoms
**Get HIV tested regularly
**Get tested for other [[sexually transmitted infections]]
**Get [[harm reduction]] education
**Reduce one's number of sexual partners
* PrEP has been shown to be effective for those taking it daily and ineffective for people who forget or skip doses

===International Partnership for Microbicides===
The [[International Partnership for Microbicides]] issued a statement by founder [[Zeda Rosenberg]] saying that &quot;The hard work and dedication of the iPrEx team and trial participants has led to a second successful proof-of-concept this year for an ARV-based HIV-prevention product. We must not falter at this important time in history when science shows us that, with sufficient resolve, we can begin to control and potentially reverse the HIV epidemic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipmglobal.org/publications-media/iprex-clinical-trial-demonstrates-44-protection-against-hiv |title=iPrEx Clinical Trial Demonstrates 44 Percent Protection Against HIV - Mounting Evidence of the Power of ARVs to Prevent HIV Transmission |author=Zeda Rosenberg |date=23 Nov 2011 |website= |publisher=[[International Partnership for Microbicides]] |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FDA approval of Truvada for PrEP===
On 27 August 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of Truvada as PrEP for sexually active adults, based on the results of two clinical trials: iPrEx and PartnersPrEP.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, FDA Approves firstdrug for reduction the risk of sexually acquired HIV infection (16 July 2012)(https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm312210.htm) Retrieved 1 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPrEx OLE==
{{unreferenced|section|date=June 2019}}
[[File:IPrEx OLE logo.jpg|right|thumb|183x183px|iPrEx OLE logo]]
iPrEx OLE (OLE stands for [[Open-label trial|Open Label Extension]]) is a continuation of the iPrEx study designed to provide additional information about the safety of PrEP and the behavior of people taking PrEP over a longer term, including information on:
*Long-term efficacy
*Long-term safety
*Pill taking and adherence
*Any changes in participants’ sexual behavior
*Drug resistance
*Bone mineral density and fat distribution
*Impact on hepatitis infection 
It is hoped that participants’ knowledge that Truvada PrEP is safe and effective for HIV infection, and that no placebo is used in the study, will lead to increased use of the study drug and increased protection against HIV infection among in iPrEx OLE participants.

iPrEx OLE started enrollment on 13 June 2011 at the San Francisco Department of Public Health in California, USA and closed enrollment in July 2012 at Investigaciones Medicas en Salud in Lima, Peru.

All participants enrolled in the first phase of the iPrEx study were invited to continue in the Open Label Extension.  Through iPrEx OLE, all HIV-negative study participants who choose to take it receive daily oral PrEP with Truvada. HIV-positive study participants receive regular medical monitoring and other services through iPrEx OLE, but do not receive the study drug, which is designed to prevent HIV infection.

'''Sts. Peter and Paul Church''' ({{lang-ru|Св. Петр и Пол Черч}}) is a [[Russian Orthodox church]]  on [[St. Paul Island, Alaska]].  The current church, built in 1907, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; Now it is under [[Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska|Diocese of Alaska]] of the [[Orthodox Church in America]]&lt;ref&gt;https://oca.org/parishes/oca-ak-stpspp&lt;/ref&gt;.

A first church was built in 1779 &quot;according to legend&quot;;  a second church was built in 1819 atop the island's tallest hill.  The current church was built in 1907, and was then &quot;one of the most ambitiously designed and effectively executed small churches of the Byzantine tradition in Alaska.&quot;  Its onion domes, however, were repeatedly damaged in storms, and have been replaced.&lt;ref name=nrhptr&gt;{{cite web |url={{NRHP url|id=64000002}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Russian Orthodox Church Buildings and Sites Thematic Resources |author=Alfred Mongin and Father Joseph P.

The '''Ole Carlson House''' is a historic [[farmhouse]] in [[Dodge County, Minnesota]]. Located in [[Canisteo Township, Dodge County, Minnesota|Canisteo Township]], it is  on County Road 15, approximately {{convert|8|mi}} south of  [[Kasson, Minnesota]].   In 1981, the home remained in the ownership of the grandson and great-grandson of Ole Carlson. The private home was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) on April 16, 1982.&lt;ref name=MHPIF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/155564-ole-carlson-house/|title=Ole Carlson House|publisher =LandmarkHunter.com|accessdate= February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Olecarlsonslide.jpg|thumb|left|The Ole Carlson House, not long after its construction.  Note the existence of [[balustrade]] and lack of plantings.]]

The Ole Carlson House was both designed and built by Ole Anderson Aasved for his neighbor Ole Carlson, a fellow [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] immigrant farmer.  Its location on a slight elevation makes the structure very visible.  The house is a large, two-story, almost square brick structure, symmetrical in arrangement with a [[hip roof]] and roof deck, with a projecting central [[gable]]d pavilion.  At the time the home was completed, it had a [[balustrade]] along the edge of the roof deck, however it is no longer present.  In addition to the main house, a small one-story brick addition on the eastern side (rear) houses a [[Kitchen#Colonial American kitchens|summer kitchen]]. The south foundation includes a [[datestone]] with the name &quot;O. A. Aasved&quot; and the date &quot;1880&quot;.&lt;ref name=MHPIF&gt;Robert M. Frame III, Minnesota Historic Properties Inventory Form, June 5, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design includes elements reminiscent of the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]], which are often found in rural Minnesota farmhouses of the era and used to emphasize verticality.  These elements include two-over-two double-hung [[sash windows]] in tall rectangular openings with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] segmental-arch hoods, and hooded double front entrance.  Unlike similar houses, conventional [[eave]] [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] were never applied to the house.&lt;ref name=MHPIF/&gt;

==History==
The builder, Ole Anderson Aasved, was born in March 1826 near [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]].  Raised on a farm, he had almost no formal education, but he sought to educate himself.  Aasved was married several times.  He married Christiana Anderson in 1849, and the couple had one child, Christiana (later Mrs. Martin Peterson), before his wife died in 1854.  Aasved moved to the United States in 1857, and in 1860 he married fellow Norwegian native Ingred Alexson; they had one daughter, Anna, before Alexson died in 1869.  He worked in logging Michigan before settling in Minnesota. In 1865 he enlisted in the [[2nd Minnesota Volunteer Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Union Army]], but saw no active service and was discharged in the same year.&lt;ref name=CtyHistory1884&gt;H.A.

In Minnesota, Aasved accumulated {{convert|220|acres}} of land in adjacent {{convert|140|acres}} and {{convert|80|acres}} parcels.  Aasved finished his own residence in 1882 at a cost of $3,000.  In 1883 he married a third time, to fellow Norwegian immigrant Benedicka Hanson.&lt;ref name=CtyHistory1884/&gt;

==Significance==
The Ole Carlson House was selected for placement on the NRHP based on its significance to the agricultural history of the Upper Midwest, its own unique architecture, and as an example of the ethnic settlements of early [[Norwegian American]]s.  A county history of 1884 declared that the house was &quot;the best farm house in the county.&quot;&lt;ref name=MHPIF/&gt;
